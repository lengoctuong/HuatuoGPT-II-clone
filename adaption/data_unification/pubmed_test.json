  "Effects of Phytophthora ramorum on volatile organic compound emissions of Rhododendron using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.\nPhytophthora ramorum is an invasive and devastating plant pathogen that causes sudden oak death in coastal forests in the western United States and ramorum blight in nursery ornamentals and native plants in various landscapes. As a broad host-range quarantine pest that can be asymptomatic in some hosts, P. ramorum presents significant challenges for regulatory efforts to detect and contain it, particularly in commercial nurseries. As part of a program to develop new detection methods for cryptic infections in nursery stock, we compared volatile emissions of P. ramorum-inoculated and noninoculated Rhododendron plants using three gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. The first used a branch enclosure combined with headspace sorptive extraction to measure plant volatiles in situ. Seventy-eight compounds were found in the general Rhododendron profile. The volatile profile of inoculated but asymptomatic plants (121 days post-inoculation) was distinguishable from the profile of the noninoculated controls. Three compounds were less abundant in inoculated Rhododendron plants relative to noninoculated and mock-inoculated control plants. A second method employed stir bar sorptive extraction to measure volatiles in vitro from leaf extractions in methanol; 114 volatiles were found in the overall profile with 30 compounds less abundant and one compound more abundant in inoculated Rhododendron plants relative to mock-inoculated plants. At 128 days post-inoculation, plants were asymptomatic and similar in appearance to the noninoculated controls, but their chemical profiles were different. In a third technique, volatiles from water runoff from the soil of potted healthy and inoculated Rhododendron plants were compared. Runoff from the inoculated plants contained four unique volatile compounds that never appeared in the runoff from mock-inoculated plants. These three volatile detection techniques could lead to innovative approaches that augment detection and diagnosis of P. ramorum and oomycete pathogens in nurseries and other settings. Graphical abstract Detection of volatile signatures may aid in discriminating healthy vs. infected but asymptomatic plants in nursery and greenhouse facilities.",
  "Locomotion in Anaspides (Anaspidacea, Malacostraca) - insights from a morpho-functional study of thoracopods with some observations on swimming and walking.\nAnaspidacea is probably the most enigmatic higher taxon within the Malacostraca. Representatives of the genus Anaspides are often considered \"living fossils\" due to their strong resemblance to their Triassic relatives. In comparison to other extant Malacostraca, they possess a high number of plesiomorphic characters. Anaspidacea are often combined with another freshwater taxon, Bathynellacea, into the Syncarida, but actual evidence for monophyletic Syncarida is weak. Other potential sister groups are Eucarida, Euphausiacea, or Euphausiacea + Peracarida. Like Euphausiacea, Mysidacea and \"natant\" decapods, Anaspidacea show what has been called a \"caridoid facies\". In malacostracan crustaceans, a prominent mode of locomotion is swimming, as it almost certainly was for the malacostracans' common ancestor. However, when considered in detail, swimming is found to take quite different forms in the various taxa. To obtain a better understanding of the evolution of swimming, we analyzed locomotion in several species of Anaspides endemic to Tasmania. The morphology of the protopodal and exopodal musculature as well as the exo- and endoskeletal structures of the thoracopods were examined using 3D reconstruction of CLSM- and μCT data. Various aspects of locomotion were documented and described using recording techniques including in-habitat underwater filming and macro high-speed recording. Our analysis shows the high level of complexity of the muscular arrangement and skeletal construction in the thoracopods of these - in many regards plesiomorphic - malacostracans, and demonstrates the presence of epipodal musculature. Our recordings provide insight into various aspects of locomotion of Anaspides, including the congruence of locomotive kinematics in swimming and walking. Our morphological findings and observations on locomotion in Anaspides are compared to findings in other malacostracan shrimps and discussed in a phylogenetic context, with our analysis providing further support for Xenommacarida (sensuRichter, 1999: Anaspidacea + Euphausiacea + Peracarida). Further, a new hypothesis for the origin of the ventral brood pouch, the marsupium, of Peracarida is discussed. On the basis of a comparison of their morphology and biology, the oostegites which form the marsupium are suggested to be derived thoracopodal endites as present in female Anaspides. Finally, an evolutionary scenario is presented and mapped on a cladogram in which the evolution of malacostracan swimming from a common caridoid ancestor up to the different taxa present today is discussed.",
  "Transfer of the Active Ingredients of Some Plant Protection Products from Raspberry Plants to Beehives.\nPlant protection products (PPPs) have been found increasingly in the environment. They pose a huge threat to bees, contributing to honeybee colony losses and consequently to enormous economic losses. Therefore, this field investigation was designed to determine whether their active ingredients (AIs) were transferred from raspberry plants to beehives located in the immediate neighbourhood of the crop and to what extent they were transferred. Every week for 2 months, samples of soil, raspberry leaves, flowers and fruits, worker bees, honeybee brood, and honey were collected and analysed for the presence of propyzamide, chlorpyrifos, iprodione, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, cypermethrin, difenoconazole, azoxystrobin, and pyrimethanil residues. Five of these substances were found in the worker bee bodies. Chlorpyrifos, applied to only the soil through the irrigation system, also was detected in the brood. A small amount of boscalid was noted in the honey, but its residues did not exceed the maximum residue level. For chlorpyrifos, boscalid, and pyrimethanil, a positive correlation between the occurrence of PPPs in the crops and the beehives was found. Statistical methods confirmed that the application of PPPs on a raspberry plantation, as an example of nectar-secreting plants, was linked to the transfer of their AIs to beehives.",
  "Trazodone alleviates both dyskinesia and psychosis in the parkinsonian marmoset model of Parkinson's disease.\nTrazodone is a clinically available anti-depressant that exhibits affinity for serotonin 1A and 2A receptors, as well as for alpha-adrenoceptors, suggesting that it may be useful to treat L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia and psychosis that are encountered in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated the anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of trazodone in the parkinsonian non-human primate. 6 common marmosets were rendered parkinsonian by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Following repeated administration of L-DOPA to induce stable dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs), trazodone (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered in combination with L-DOPA and its effects on dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonism were determined. The addition of trazodone 10 mg/kg to L-DOPA reduced peak dose dyskinesia by ≈ 39% (P < 0.01) and peak dose PLBs by ≈ 17% (P < 0.01). However, parkinsonian disability was significantly worsened by trazodone 10 mg/kg (P < 0.05) and duration of anti-parkinsonian action was diminished by ≈ 21% (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that trazodone may be effective in alleviating L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and psychosis in PD, but its deleterious effect on motor function is a concern and may limit its tolerability and usefulness in clinical settings.",
  "Probabilistic interpretation of the Amelogenin locus.\nWe describe a method to assign weights to genotype combinations at the Amelogenin locus. It is a typical practise in forensic laboratories that once the weight exceeds a threshold (such as 99 %), then they can be considered to be resolved enough to interpret (for example to load onto a database). We found that unless an individual is a clear major (or minor) contributor, the genotype weights do not typically exceed 99 % for any genotype. LRs have not been traditionally assigned for the Amelogenin locus and are small compared to an LR assigned for a modern day STR multiplex where, for a more discriminatory locus, the per locus LR for a resolved contributor could be in the order of tens or hundreds. The method described uses per contributor template values for a previously interpreted profile. The discrimination power is restricted, with a maximum possible LR of 2 for a fully resolved genotype, due to the limited number of alleles and hence genotypes and assuming equal proportions of genders in the population. However, it has a good power to exclude when the component is well resolved and non-concordant with a POI.",
  "Surface properties of PM2.5 calcite fine particulate matter in the presence of same size bacterial cells and exocellular polymeric substances (EPS) of Bacillus mucitaginosus.\nMicroorganism cells and spores are the main components of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) as well as fine mineral particles. In the microscopic system, the microorganisms will affect the minerals through attachment, charge neutralization, and dissolution related to the cell surface structure and metabolite. To explore the process and the results of microbial cells and their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) acting on the surface properties of minerals of PM2.5 through the metabolism, a common native soil bacterium Bacillus mucitaginosus with abundant extracellular polymers was chosen as the tested strain. Meanwhile, as one of the PM2.5 common minerals, calcite fine particles were taken as the research object to explore the influence of microbial cells and extracellular polymers on its surface properties. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP), Zeta potential analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the composition of EPS, the soluble ions, surface charge, surface groups, crystal form, and surface morphology of calcite residual solid after being treated by the bacterial cells and EPS. The results revealed the EPS of B. mucitaginosus mainly consisted of protein and polysaccharides. Both the whole cell and its EPS could promote the dissolution of calcite particles into calcium ions. Due to the adhesion of organic groups on the calcite surface, the surface potential shifted significantly in the negative direction and the solution pH was clearly increased. The morphology of calcite surface was significantly changed after dissolution and re-crystallization. Experimental results also showed that the existence of the bacteria cells and EPS significantly affected the surface properties of calcite and provide a theoretical basis for the mechanism of PM fine particulate matter on human health impact for further study.",
  "Technology acceptance perception for promotion of sustainable consumption.\nEconomic growth in the past decades has resulted in change in consumption pattern and emergence of tech-savvy generation with unprecedented increase in the usage of social network technology. In this paper, the technology acceptance value gap adapted from the technology acceptance model has been applied as a tool supporting social network technology usage and subsequent promotion of sustainable consumption. The data generated through the use of structured questionnaires have been analyzed using structural equation modeling. The validity of the model and path estimates signifies the robustness of Technology Acceptance value gap in adjudicating the efficiency of social network technology usage in augmentation of sustainable consumption and awareness. The results indicate that subjective norm gap, ease-of-operation gap, and quality of green information gap have the most adversarial impact on social network technology usage. Eventually social networking technology usage has been identified as a significant antecedent of sustainable consumption.",
  "Temporal Trend of Near Miss and its Regional Variations in Brazil from 2010 to 2018.\nCases of maternal near miss are those in which women survive severe maternal complications during pregnancy or the puerperium. This ecological study aimed to identify the temporal trend of near-miss cases in different regions of Brazil between 2010 and 2018, using data from the Hospital Information System (HIS) of the Unified Brazilian Health System (SUS, in the Portuguese acronym). Hospital admission records of women between 10 and 49 years old with diagnosis included in the 10<sup>th</sup> Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and codes indicating near-miss events were selected. From 20,891,040 admissions due to obstetric causes, 766,249 (3.66%) near-miss cases were identified, and 31,475 women needed admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The cases were found to be more predominant in black women over 35 years old from the North and Northeast regions. There was a trend of increase in near-miss rates of &#8764; 13.5% a year during the period of the study. The trend presented a different behavior depending on the level of development of the region studied. The main causes of near miss were preeclampsia (47%), hemorrhage (24%), and sepsis (18%).",
  "Asthma Mimickers: Approach to Differential Diagnosis.\nThe airway of a child can be easily obstructed because of its small size and there are myriad conditions that may obstruct it. Though asthma is the most common condition causing reversible obstruction of the airway; there are a large number of conditions which can obstruct the airway both reversibly and irreversibly. These asthma mimics can present as clinical problems from the neonatal period through adolescence. This article presents an overview of the clinical situations that must be kept in mind when the child presents with subtly unusual clinical features or a deviant course. This is followed by a brief description of the common mimickers along with clinical clues to their diagnosis. Clinicians will need a high index of suspicion for diagnosing these conditions. Prompt recognition and optimal case management and referral will ensure the best outcomes in these children.",
  "Cross-talk Between Histone and DNA Methylation Mediates Bone Loss in Hind Limb Unloading.\nBone loss induced by mechanical unloading is a common skeletal disease, but the precise mechanism remains unclear. The current study investigated the role of histone methylation, a key epigenetic marker, and its cross-talk with DNA methylation in bone loss induced by mechanical unloading. The expression of G9a, ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1), and DNA methylation transferase 1 (DNMT1) were increased in hind limb unloading (HLU) rats. This was accompanied by an increased level of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) di-/tri-methylation at lncH19 promoter. Then, alteration of G9a, DNMT1, or UHRF1 expression significantly affected lncH19 level and osteogenic activity in UMR106 cells. Osteogenic gene expression and matrix mineralization were robustly promoted after simultaneous knockdown of G9a, DNMT1, and UHRF1. Furthermore, physical interactions of lncH19 promoter with G9a and DNMT1, as well as direct interactions among DNMT1, G9a, and UHRF1 were detected. Importantly, overexpression of DNMT1, G9a, or UHRF1, respectively, resulted in enrichment of H3K9me2/me3 and 5-methylcytosine at lncH19 promoter. Finally, in vivo rescue experiments indicated that knockdown of DNMT1, G9a, or UHRF1 significantly relieved bone loss in HLU rats. In conclusion, our research demonstrated the critical role of H3K9 methylation and its cross-talk with DNA methylation in regulating lncH19 expression and bone loss in HLU rats. Combined targeting of DNMT1, G9a, and UHRF1 could be a promising strategy for the treatment of bone loss induced by mechanical unloading. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).",
  "Exposure of Human Skin Models to KrCl Excimer Lamps: The Impact of Optical Filtering<sup>&#8224;</sup>.\nFar-UVC radiation is a promising technology that is potentially both effective at killing airborne microbes such as coronaviruses and influenza, and being minimally hazardous to the skin and eyes. Our previous studies on health risks from far-UVC have employed a krypton-chloride (KrCl) excimer lamp, emitting principally at 222&#160;nm, supplemented with an optical filter to remove longer wavelength emissions inherent to these lamps. This study explores KrCl lamp health hazards by comparing filtered and unfiltered KrCl lamps using effective spectral irradiance calculations and experimental skin exposures. Analysis of effective irradiances showed a notable increase in allowable exposure when using a filter. Induction of DNA dimers (CPD and 6-4PP) was measured in human skin models exposed to a range of radiant exposures up to 500&#160;mJ&#160;cm<sup>-2</sup> . Compared to sham-exposed tissues, the unfiltered KrCl lamps induced a statistically significant increase in the yield of both DNA lesions at all the radiant exposures studied. Conversely, filtered KrCl lamps do not induce increased levels of dimers at the current daily TLV exposure limit for 222&#160;nm (23&#160;mJ&#160;cm<sup>-2</sup> ). This work supports the use of filters for far-UVC KrCl excimer lamps when used to limit disease transmission in occupied locations.",
  "Ichthyophthirius multifiliis impairs splenic enzymes of the phosphoryl transfer network in naturally infected Rhamdia quelen: effects on energetic homeostasis.\nIts integrated energetic and metabolic signaling roles place the phosphoryl transfer network, through the enzymes creatine kinase (CK), adenylate kinase (AK), and pyruvate kinase (PK), as a regulatory system coordinating components of the cellular bioenergetics network. Analysis of these enzymes provides new information and perspectives with which to understand disturbances in energetic metabolism between sites of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation and utilization. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the involvement of the phosphoryl transfer network in splenic tissue linked with the pathogenesis of silver catfish naturally infected with Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. Splenic cytosolic and mitochondrial CK activities decreased in infected animals compared to uninfected animals, as was also observed for splenic PK activity and splenic ATP levels. In contrast, splenic AK activity increased in infected animals compared to uninfected animals. Based on this evidence, the inhibition and absence of efficient communication between CK isoenzymes cause the impairment of splenic bioenergetics, which is in turn compensated by the augmentation of splenic AK activity in an attempt to restore energy homeostasis. The inhibition of splenic PK activity impairs communication between sites of ATP generation and ATP utilization, as corroborated by splenic ATP depletion. In summary, these alterations contribute to disease pathogenesis linked to spleen tissue in animals infected with white spot disease.",
  "Relationships of oxidized HDL with blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nAlthough oxidization of LDL is known to be a crucial step for atherosclerotic progression, the significance of oxidized HDL remains to be clarified. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships of oxidized HDL with blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with diabetes. The subjects were outpatients with type 2 diabetes (n = 163; median hemoglobin A1c, 6.9%). Activities of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis were evaluated by levels of thrombin-anti-thrombin complex (TAT) and plasmin-α2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), respectively. Relationships of oxidized HDL with TAT and PIC were investigated by using linear regression analysis and logistic regression analysis. Oxidized HDL showed a significant inverse correlation with TAT and a marginally significant correlation with PIC (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: TAT, - 0.205 [p < 0.01]; PIC, - 0.135 [p = 0.087]). Prevalence of high TAT was significantly lower in the 3rd tertile group for oxidized HDL than in its 1st tertile (20.4 vs. 5.6%, p < 0.05), and prevalence of high PIC was marginally significantly lower in the 3rd tertile group for oxidized HDL than in its 1st tertile (40.7 vs. 24.1%, p = 0.099). In multivariate logistic regression analysis using age, gender, smoking, alcohol drinking, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, therapy for dyslipidemia, therapy for diabetes and anti-coagulation therapy as explanatory variables, odds ratios for high TAT and high PIC in the 3rd tertile group for oxidized HDL versus its 1st tertile group were significantly lower than the reference level of 1.00 (high TAT: 0.19 [0.04-0.99], p < 0.05; high PIC: 0.33 [0.12-0.95], p < 0.05). The frequency of high TAT or high PIC was lower in the higher tertile group for oxidized HDL than in its lower tertile group. Thus, oxidized HDL is thought to be inversely associated with both blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with type 2 diabetes.",
  "Peptidoglycan synthesis in Tannerella forsythia: Scavenging is the modus operandi.\nTannerella forsythia is a Gram-negative oral pathogen strongly associated with periodontitis. This bacterium has an absolute requirement for exogenous N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), an amino sugar that forms the repeating disaccharide unit with amino sugar N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) of the peptidoglycan backbone. In silico genome analysis indicates that T. forsythia lacks the key biosynthetic enzymes needed for the de novo synthesis of MurNAc, and so relies on alternative ways to meet its requirement for peptidoglycan biosynthesis. In the subgingival niche, the bacterium can acquire MurNAc and peptidoglycan fragments (muropeptides) released by the cohabiting bacteria during their cell wall breakdown associated with cell division. Tannerella forsythia is able to also use host sialic acid (Neu5Ac) in lieu of MurNAc or muropeptides for its survival during the biofilm growth. Evidence suggests that the bacterium might be able to shunt sialic acid into a metabolic pathway leading to peptidoglycan synthesis. In this review, we explore the mechanisms by which T. forsythia is able to scavenge MurNAc, muropeptide and sialic acid for its peptidoglycan synthesis, and the impact of these scavenging activities on pathogenesis.",
  "Tobacco Mosaic Virus Functionalized Alginate Hydrogel Scaffolds for Bone Regeneration in Rats with Cranial Defect.\nPlant viruses have been highlighted among material research due to their well-defined structures in nanoscale, monodispersity, stability, and chemical functionalities. Each of the thousands coat protein subunits on a viral nanoparticle can be homogeneously modified, chemically and genetically, with a functional ligand leading to a high-density and spatial distribution of ligands on each particle (multivalency). Previous reports from our group have evidenced that substrates coated with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and its mutant promote early osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We then fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) biopolymeric scaffold with rod-like TMV in the form of a sponge-like hydrogel for tissue engineering purposes. The hydrogel was functionalized with the cellular recognition peptide, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), through an incorporation of an RGD mutant of TMV (TMV-RGD). The virus-functionalized hydrogel materials were shown to aid bone differentiation of MSCs in vitro. Herein, we performed an in vivo study based on the TMV and TMV-RGD hydrogels in Sprague-Dawley rats with cranial bone defects. This report substantiated the hypothesis that TMV-functionalized hydrogel scaffolds did not cause systemic toxicity when implanted in the defect site and that the TMV-based hydrogel platform can support cell localization and can be further optimized for bone regeneration and repair.",
  "A Dual-Color Luminescent Localized Drug Delivery System with Ratiometric-Monitored Doxorubicin Release Functionalities.\nImplantable localized drug delivery systems (LDDSs) have been intensively investigated for cancer therapy. However, the anticancer agent release behavior as well as the local therapeutic process in the complex physiological environment remains a dark zone and consequently hinders their clinical applications. Herein, a series of Er<sup>3+</sup>-doped electrospun strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, STO) nanofibers with refined microstructural characteristics were exploited as a localized carrier for doxorubicin (DOX) delivery due to its light-responsive functionalities as well as expected biocompatibility. The highest DOX loading capacity and sustained releasing kinetics were obtained from the nanofibers with the highest surface area and lowest pore dimensions. Consequently, such nanofibers presented stronger in vitro anticancer efficacy to Hep G2 cells compared to that of other samples. More importantly, the amount of drug released was monitored by the ratio of green-to-red emission (<i>I</i><sub>550</sub>/<i>I</i><sub>660</sub>) due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect built between DOX molecules and upconversion photoluminescent nanofibers. The selective quenching effect of green emission due to DOX molecules was gradually weakened with drug releasing progress, whereas the intensity of red emission barely changed, resulting in an increased <i>I</i><sub>550</sub>/<i>I</i><sub>660</sub> ratio. Such color evolution can be feasibly visualized by the naked eye. Monitoring with a spectral intensity ratio eliminates the disturbance of uncertainties in the complex physiological environment compared to just referring to the emission intensity. Such dual-color luminescent STO:Er nanofibers, designed based on the FRET mechanism, are therefore considered to be a promising new LDDS platform with ratiometric-monitored DOX release functionalities for future localized tumor therapeutic strategies.",
  "In Situ Spectroscopic Screening of Osteosarcoma Living Cells on Stoichiometry-Modulated Silicon Nitride Bioceramic Surfaces.\nOsteosarcoma cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation into osteoblasts on a silicon nitride bioceramic were examined as a function of chemical modifications of its as-fired surface. Biological and spectroscopic analyses showed that (i) postsintering annealing in N<sub>2</sub> gas significantly improved apatite formation from human osteosarcoma (SaOS-2) cells; (ii) in situ Raman spectroscopic monitoring revealed new metabolic details of the SaOS-2 cells, including fine differences in intracellular RNA and membrane phospholipids; and (iii) the enhanced apatite formation originated from a high density of positively charged surface groups, including both nitrogen vacancies (V<sub>N</sub><sup>3+</sup>) and nitrogen N-N bonds (N<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) formed during annealing in N<sub>2</sub> gas. At homeostatic pH, these positive surface charges promoted binding of proteins onto an otherwise negatively charged surface of deprotonated silanols (SiO<sup>-</sup>). A dipole-like electric-charge, which includes V<sub>N</sub><sup>3+</sup>/N<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and SiO<sup>-</sup> defective sites, is proposed as a mechanism to explain the attractive forces between transmembrane proteins and the COO<sup>-</sup> and NH<sup>2+</sup> termini, respectively. This is analogous to the mechanism occurring in mineral hydroxyapatite where protein groups are specifically displaced by the presence of positively charged calcium loci (Ca<sup>+</sup>) and off-stoichiometry phosphorus sites (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>).",
  "New evidence of connections between increased O-GlcNAcylation and inflammasome in the oral mucosa of patients with oral lichen planus.\nOral lichen planus (OLP) is considered a chronic inflammatory immune-mediated disease of the oral mucosa. Immunopathogenesis of OLP is thought to be associated with cell-mediated immune dysregulation. O-GlcNAcylation is a form of reversible glycosylation. It has been demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation promoted nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling. Activation of NF-кB can induce expression of nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is a large intracellular multi-protein complex involving an immune response. Dysregulated expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome was reported to be associated with autoinflammatory diseases. No integrative studies between O-GlcNAcylation and NLRP3 inflammasome in OLP patients have been reported. The present study aimed to determine the immunohistochemical expression of O-GlcNAcylation, NF-κB signalling molecules and NLRP3 inflammasome in oral mucosae of OLP patients. Oral tissue samples were collected from 30 OLP patients and 30 healthy individuals. Immunohistochemical staining and analyses of immunostaining scores were performed to evaluate expression of O-GlcNAcylation, NF-κB signalling molecules and NLRP3 inflammasome. According to observations in this study, significantly higher levels of O-GlcNAcylation, NF-κB signalling molecules and NLRP3 inflammasome were demonstrated in OLP patients compared with control subjects (P < 0·001). Positive correlations among O-GlcNAcylation, NF-κB signalling molecules and NLRP3 inflammasome were also observed in OLP samples (P < 0·01). In conclusion, the present study provides supportive evidence that increased O-GlcNAcylation is associated with increased expression of NLRP3 inflammasome via the NF-κB signalling pathway. These findings provide a new perspective on immunopathogenesis of OLP in relation to autoinflammation.",
  "Impact of obstructive sleep apnea on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism: Rationale and methodology for the POPE study.\nIn normotensive patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), the effect of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes lacks clarity. The Prognostic Significance of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients With Acute Symptomatic Pulmonary Embolism (POPE) study is a multicenter, observational study designed to prospectively assess the prognostic significance of concomitant OSA in hemodynamically stable outpatients with acute symptomatic PE. Adult patients with acute stable PE are eligible. Recruited patients undergo an overnight sleep study using a level III portable diagnostic device within 7 days (and preferably within 48 hours) of diagnosis of PE. The sleep tracings are analyzed by a certified sleep technologist and audited by a sleep physician, both of whom are blinded to other study data. The patients are divided into 2 groups based on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): OSA (AHI ≥15) and non-OSA (AHI <15) groups. The study uses a composite of PE-related death, CV death, clinical deterioration requiring an escalation of treatment, or nonfatal CV events (recurrent venous thromboembolism, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke) within 30 days after the diagnosis of PE as the primary outcome. The projected sample size of 225 patients will provide 80% power to test the hypothesis that OSA will increase the primary outcome from 7% in the non-OSA group to 20% in the OSA group, with α ≤0.05. The trial results will be important to understand the burden and CV effects of OSA in PE patients.",
  "Effects of shRNA-mediated silencing of PSMA7 on cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor expression via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in cervical cancer.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effects of PSMA7 silencing on cervical cancer (CC) cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. CC tissues (n = 43) and normal tissues (n = 27) were first collected from patients. Human CC cell line (SiHa) and human normal cervical epithelial cells (H8) were obtained and classified into the normal, blank, negative control (NC), PSMA7-shRNA1, and PSMA7-shRNA2 groups, respectively. In situ hybridization was used to detect the expressions of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins. Immunofluorescence assay was carried out to test the activity of 20S proteasomes. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were both performed to determine the expressions of PSMA7, ubiquitin, P27, P53, and VEGF in sample tissues and cells. 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to analyze cell proliferation rates, and flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and the apoptotic rate. Compared with normal tissues, CC tissues showed increased expression levels of PSMA7, ubiquitin, p53, VEGF as well as increased activity of 20S proteasomes but exhibited a decrease in p27 expression. Compared with the blank and NC groups, the PSMA7-shRNA1 and PSMA7-shRNA2 groups all had decreased expression levels of PSMA7, ubiquitin, p53, and VEGF as well as decreased cell proliferation, 20S proteasomes activity, and cell number in the S phase, increased p27 expression, cell apoptosis and cell number in the G0/G1 phase. Our study demonstrated that PSMA7 silencing can suppress CC cell proliferation and VEGF expression in addition to promoting cell apoptosis through inhibiting the UPP signaling pathway.",
  "Collagen Fibril Intermolecular Spacing Changes with 2-Propanol: A Mechanism for Tissue Stiffness.\nMaterials composed primarily of collagen are important as surgical scaffolds and other medical devices and require flexibility. However, the factors that control the suppleness and flexibility of these materials are not well understood. Acellular dermal matrix materials in aqueous mixtures of 2-propanol were studied. Synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering was used to characterize the collagen structure and structural arrangement. Stiffness was measured by bend tests. Bend modulus increased logarithmically with 2-propanol concentration from 0.5 kPa in water to 103 kPa in pure 2-propanol. The intermolecular spacing between tropocollagen molecules decreased from 15.3 to 11.4 Å with increasing 2-propanol concentration while fibril diameter decreased from 57.2 to 37.2 nm. D-spacing initially increased from 63.6 to 64.2 nm at 50% 2-propanol then decreased to 60.3 nm in pure 2-propanol. The decrease in intermolecular spacing and fibril diameter are due to removal of water and the collapse of the hydrogen bond structure between tropocollagen molecules causing closer packing of the molecules within a fibril. We speculate this tighter molecular packing may restrict the sliding of collagen within fibrils, and similar disruption of the extended hydration layer between fibrils may lead to restriction of sliding between fibrils. This mechanism for tissue stiffness may be more general.",
  "Rice histone deacetylase 10 and Arabidopsis histone deacetylase 14 genes encode N-acetylserotonin deacetylase, which catalyzes conversion of N-acetylserotonin into serotonin, a reverse reaction for melatonin biosynthesis in plants.\nIn plants, melatonin production is strictly regulated, unlike the production of its precursor, serotonin, which is highly inducible in response to stimuli, such as senescence and pathogen exposure. Exogenous serotonin treatment does not greatly induce the production of N-acetylserotonin (NAS) and melatonin in plants, which suggests the possible existence of one or more regulatory genes in the pathway for the biosynthesis of melatonin from serotonin. In this report, we found that NAS was rapidly and abundantly converted into serotonin in rice seedlings, indicating the presence of an N-acetylserotonin deacetylase (ASDAC). To clone the putative ASDAC gene, we screened 4 genes that were known as histone deacetylase (HDAC) genes, but encoded proteins targeted into chloroplasts or mitochondria rather than nuclei. Of 4 recombinant Escherichia coli strains expressing these genes, one E. coli strain expressing the rice HDAC10 gene was found to be capable of producing serotonin in response to treatment with NAS. The recombinant purified rice HDAC10 (OsHDAC10) protein exhibited ASDAC enzyme activity toward NAS, N-acetyltyramine (NAT), N-acetyltryptamine, and melatonin, with the highest ASDAC activity for NAT. In addition, its Arabidopsis ortholog, AtHDAC14, showed similar ASDAC activity to that of OsHDAC10. Both OsHDAC10 and AtHDAC14 were found to be expressed in chloroplasts. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ASDAC homologs were present in archaea, but not in cyanobacteria, which differs from the distribution of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT). This suggests that SNAT and ASDAC may have evolved differently from ancestral eukaryotic cells.",
  "Acetylcholine precursor, citicoline (cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine), reduces hypoglycaemia-induced neuronal death in rats.\nCiticoline (cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine) is an important precursor for the synthesis of neuronal plasma membrane phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine. The administration of citicoline serves as a choline donor for the synthesis of acetylcholine. Citicoline has been shown to reduce the neuronal injury in animal models with cerebral ischaemia and in clinical trials of stroke patients. Citicoline is currently being investigated in a multicentre clinical trial. However, citicoline has not yet been examined the context of hypoglycaemia-induced neuronal death. To clarify the therapeutic impact of citicoline in hypoglycaemia-induced neuronal death, we used a rat model with insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Acute hypoglycaemia was induced by i.p. injection of regular insulin (10&#160;U&#160;kg<sup>-1</sup> ) after overnight fasting, after which iso-electricity was maintained for 30&#160;minutes. Citicoline injections (500&#160;mg/kg, i.p.) were started immediately after glucose reperfusion. We found that post-treatment of citicoline resulted in significantly reduced neuronal death, oxidative injury and microglial activation in the hippocampus compared to vehicle-treated control groups at 7&#160;days after induced hypoglycaemia. Citicoline administration after hypoglycaemia decreased immunoglobulin leakage via blood-brain barrier disruption in the hippocampus compared to the vehicle group. Citicoline increased choline acetyltransferase expression for phosphatidylcholine synthesis after hypoglycaemia. Altogether, the present findings suggest that neuronal membrane stabilisation by citicoline administration can save neurones from the degeneration process after hypoglycaemia, as seen in several studies of ischaemia. Therefore, the results suggest that citicoline may have therapeutic potential to reduce hypoglycaemia-induced neuronal death.",
  "Bioerosion of Synthetic Sling Explants.\nThis study was performed to investigate the changes over time in polypropylene (PP) mesh explants from women with stress urinary incontinence originally treated with a midurethral PP sling. Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, 10 PP explants removed for pain or obstructive symptoms between January and June 2016 were analyzed through various techniques to determine the degradation of the material in vivo. Exclusion criteria were exposed or infected mesh sling or sling in place for less than six months. One pristine control was studied for comparison. The explant samples were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy to visualize the surface defects as well as infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to determine if the degradation was oxidative in nature. The results show qualitative and quantitative bioerosion over the surface of the explant samples and an increase in the content of oxygen pointing toward oxidative degradation occurring in vivo.",
  "Local differentiation of cell wall matrix polysaccharides in sinuous pavement cells: its possible involvement in the flexibility of cell shape.\nThe distribution of homogalacturonans (HGAs) displaying different degrees of esterification as well as of callose was examined in cell walls of mature pavement cells in two angiosperm and two fern species. We investigated whether local cell wall matrix differentiation may enable pavement cells to respond to mechanical tension forces by transiently altering their shape. HGA epitopes, identified with 2F4, JIM5 and JIM7 antibodies, and callose were immunolocalised in hand-made or semithin leaf sections. Callose was also stained with aniline blue. The structure of pavement cells was studied with light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In all species examined, pavement cells displayed wavy anticlinal cell walls, but the waviness pattern differed between angiosperms and ferns. The angiosperm pavement cells were tightly interconnected throughout their whole depth, while in ferns they were interconnected only close to the external periclinal cell wall and intercellular spaces were developed between them close to the mesophyll. Although the HGA epitopes examined were located along the whole cell wall surface, the 2F4- and JIM5- epitopes were especially localised at cell lobe tips. In fern pavement cells, the contact sites were impregnated with callose and JIM5-HGA epitopes. When tension forces were applied on leaf regions, the pavement cells elongated along the stretching axis, due to a decrease in waviness of anticlinal cell walls. After removal of tension forces, the original cell shape was resumed. The presented data support that HGA epitopes make the anticlinal pavement cell walls flexible, in order to reversibly alter their shape. Furthermore, callose seems to offer stability to cell contacts between pavement cells, as already suggested in photosynthetic mesophyll cells.",
  "Successful refolding and NMR structure of rMagi3: A disulfide-rich insecticidal spider toxin.\nThe need for molecules with high specificity against noxious insects leads the search towards spider venoms that have evolved highly selective toxins for insect preys. In this respect, spiders as a highly diversified group of almost exclusive insect predators appear to possess infinite potential for the discovery of novel insect-selective toxins. In 2003, a group of toxins was isolated from the spider Macrothele gigas and the amino acid sequence was reported. We obtained, by molecular biology techniques in a heterologous system, one of these toxins. Purification process was optimized by chromatographic methods to determine the three-dimensional structure by nuclear magnetic resonance in solution, and, finally, their biological activity was tested. rMagi3 resulted to be a specific insect toxin with no effect on mice.",
  "Organic Filling Mitigates Flaw-Sensitivity of Nanoscale Aragonite.\nEngineering at nanoscale holds the promise of tuning materials with extraordinary properties. However, macroscopic approaches commonly used to predict mechanical properties do not fully apply at nanoscale level. A controversial feature is the presence of nanoflaws in aragonite nacre, as it is expected that flaws would weaken the material, whereas nacre still shows high toughness and rupture strength. Here, we performed molecular dynamics and finite element simulations emulating flaws found in aragonite nacre. Our simulations reveal two regimes for fracture: nacre remains flaw-insensitive only for flaws smaller than 1.2 nm depth, or flaws of a few atoms, whereas larger flaws follow a Griffith-like trend resembling macroscopic fracture. We tested an alternative mechanism for flaw-insensitivity in nacre, and investigated the mechanical effect of organic filling to mitigate fracture. We found that a single nacre protein, perlucin, decreases the stress concentration at the fracture point, producing enhancements of up to 15% in rupture strength. Our study reveals a more comprehensive understanding of mechanical stability at the nanoscale and offers new routes toward hybrid nanomaterials.",
  "Method for hull-less barley transformation and manipulation of grain mixed-linkage beta-glucan.\nHull-less barley is increasingly offering scope for breeding grains with improved characteristics for human nutrition; however, recalcitrance of hull-less cultivars to transformation has limited the use of these varieties. To overcome this limitation, we sought to develop an effective transformation system for hull-less barley using the cultivar Torrens. Torrens yielded a transformation efficiency of 1.8%, using a modified Agrobacterium transformation method. This method was used to over-express genes encoding synthases for the important dietary fiber component, (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan (mixed-linkage glucan), primarily present in starchy endosperm cell walls. Over-expression of the HvCslF6 gene, driven by an endosperm-specific promoter, produced lines where mixed-linkage glucan content increased on average by 45%, peaking at 70% in some lines, with smaller increases in transgenic HvCslH1 grain. Transgenic HvCslF6 lines displayed alterations where grain had a darker color, were more easily crushed than wild type and were smaller. This was associated with an enlarged cavity in the central endosperm and changes in cell morphology, including aleurone and sub-aleurone cells. This work provides proof-of-concept evidence that mixed-linkage glucan content in hull-less barley grain can be increased by over-expression of the HvCslF6 gene, but also indicates that hull-less cultivars may be more sensitive to attempts to modify cell wall composition.",
  "Site-Specific POxylation of Interleukin-4.\nPolymer conjugated biologics form a multibillion dollar market, dominated by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Recent reports linked PEGs to immunological concerns, fueling the need for alternative polymers. Therefore, we are presenting a strategy replacing PEG by poly(2-oxazoline) (POx) polymers using genetically engineered interleukin-4 (IL-4) featuring an unnatural amino acid for site-specific conjugation through bioorthogonal copper-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Conjugation yields of IL-4-PEG were poor and did not respond to an increase in the copper catalyst. In contrast, POxylated IL-4 conjugates resulted in homogeneous conjugate outcome, as demonstrated electrophoretically by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, POxylation did not impair thermal and chemical stability, and preserved wild-type IL-4 activity for the conjugates as demonstrated by TF-1 cell proliferation and STAT-6 phosphorylation in HEK293T cells, respectively. In conclusion, POxylation provides an interesting alternative to PEGylation with superior outcome for the synthesis yield by CuAAC and resulting in conjugates with excellent thermal and chemical stress profiles as well as biological performances.",
  "SaCas9 Requires 5'-NNGRRT-3' PAM for Sufficient Cleavage and Possesses Higher Cleavage Activity than SpCas9 or FnCpf1 in Human Cells.\nCRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene therapy holds great promise for the treatment of human diseases. The protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), the sequence adjacent to the target sequence, is an essential targeting component for the design of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. However, currently, very few studies have attempted to directly study the PAM sequence in human cells. To address this issue, the authors develop a dual fluorescence reporter system that could be harnessed for identifying functional PAMs for genome editing endonuclease, including Cas9. With this system, the authors investigate the effects of different PAM sequences for SaCas9, which is small and has the advantage of allowing in vivo genome editing, and found only 5'-NNGRRT-3' PAM could induced sufficient target cleavage with multi-sites. The authors also found SaCas9 possesses higher activity than SpCas9 or FnCpf1 via plasmids (episomal) and chromosomes with integrated eGFP-based comparison. Taken together, the authors show that a dual fluorescence reporter system is a means to identifying a functional PAM and quantitatively comparing the efficiency of different genome editing endonucleases with the similar or identical target sequence in human cells.",
  "Designing an Autonomous Integrated Downstream Sequence From a Batch Separation Process - An Industrial Case Study.\nThis work is a proof of concept of how a sequence of industrial batch separation steps together are used to form an integrated autonomous downstream process. The sequence in this case study consisted of an anion chromatography step, virus inactivation and finally a hydrophobic chromatography step. Moving from batch to integrated separation minimizes hold-up times, storage tanks, and required equipment. The conversion from batch to integrated mode is achieved by extracting operating points and separation data from batch chromatograms. The integrated separation process is realized on an ÄKTA Pure controlled by an open research software called Orbit, making it possible to operate complex process configurations including multiple steps. The results from this case study is the principle and method of the steps taken to automation, achieving a more continuous and efficient downstream process.",
  "Improved HPLC-method for estimation and correction of amino acid losses during hydrolysis of unknown samples.\nAmino acid analysis, commonly done by acid hydrolysis of proteins and HPLC analysis, faces one major problem: incomplete hydrolysis of stable amino acids and degradation of unstable amino acids are causing amino acid losses. As a result, amino acid recovery of unknown samples cannot be estimated. Some methods have been reported for correction of these factors in the past. This paper shows an improved and integrated method to overcome this problem by using stillage as an exemplary unknown sample material. Amino acid recovery from an unknown sample can be estimated by standard addition of a known protein. If the sample does not cause matrix effects during amino acid hydrolysis, recoveries of the standard protein are transferable to the sample. If the sample does cause matrix effects correction of amino acid losses can instead be done by determination of hydrolysis kinetics. Therefore, first order kinetics were used for amino acids that undergo degradation during hydrolysis. For all stable amino acids higher order kinetics were used, a novel approach to determine hydrolysis kinetics. The presented method can be a helpful tool for scientists who want to optimize amino acid analysis of a particular biomass substrate.",
  "Light-harvesting chlorophyll protein (LHCII) drives electron transfer in semiconductor nanocrystals.\nType-II quantum dots (QDs) are capable of light-driven charge separation between their core and the shell structures; however, their light absorption is limited in the longer-wavelength range. Biological light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) efficiently absorbs in the blue and red spectral domains. Therefore, hybrid complexes of these two structures may be promising candidates for photovoltaic applications. Previous measurements had shown that LHCII bound to QD can transfer its excitation energy to the latter, as indicated by the fluorescence emissions of LHCII and QD being quenched and sensitized, respectively. In the presence of methyl viologen (MV), both fluorescence emissions are quenched, indicating an additional electron transfer process from QDs to MV. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed this notion and showed that electron transfer from QDs to MV is much faster than fluorescence energy transfer between LHCII and QD. The action spectrum of MV reduction by LHCII-QD complexes reflected the LHCII absorption spectrum, showing that light absorbed by LHCII and transferred to QDs increased the efficiency of MV reduction by QDs. Under continuous illumination, at least 28 turnovers were observed for the MV reduction. Presumably, the holes in QD cores were filled by a reducing agent in the reaction solution or by the dihydrolipoic-acid coating of the QDs. The LHCII-QD construct can be viewed as a simple model of a photosystem with the QD component acting as reaction center.",
  "Cobalt and nickel affect the fluidity of negatively-charged biomimetic membranes.\nElevated levels of the essential trace metals cobalt and nickel are associated with a variety of toxic effects, which are not well-understood, and may involve interactions with the lipid membrane. Fluidity changes of biomimetic lipid membranes upon exposure to CoCl<sub>2</sub> and NiCl<sub>2</sub> were studied using the fluorescent probe Laurdan, which senses changes in environment polarity. Liposomes were prepared by extrusion in 20&#8239;mM HEPES&#8239;+&#8239;100&#8239;mM NaCl at pH 7.4. Additionally, dynamic light scattering was used to monitor metal induced size changes of liposomes composed of: phosphatidic acid (PA), cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylcholine (PC), with saturated and unsaturated acyl chains. Micromolar concentrations of both metals significantly rigidify negatively-charged liposomes and generally increase the melting temperature. Saturated acyl chains showed stronger metal effects in PS and PG, while no clear acyl chain preference was observed in CL and PA systems. The strength of the effect appears to be influenced greatly by both the head group and acyl chain. The rigidifying effects of cobalt were almost always much larger than those of nickel. In addition, size changes and aggregation by both metals was detected in PS or PA liposomes at molar metal/lipid ratios as low as 1/10.",
  "Buckling transitions and soft-phase invasion of two-component icosahedral shells.\nWhat is the optimal distribution of two types of crystalline phases on the surface of icosahedral shells, such as of many viral capsids? We here investigate the distribution of a thin layer of soft material on a crystalline convex icosahedral shell. We demonstrate how the shapes of spherical viruses can be understood from the perspective of elasticity theory of thin two-component shells. We develop a theory of shape transformations of an icosahedral shell upon addition of a softer, but still crystalline, material onto its surface. We show how the soft component \"invades\" the regions with the highest elastic energy and stress imposed by the 12 topological defects on the surface. We explore the phase diagram as a function of the surface fraction of the soft material, the shell size, and the incommensurability of the elastic moduli of the rigid and soft phases. We find that, as expected, progressive filling of the rigid shell by the soft phase starts from the most deformed regions of the icosahedron. With a progressively increasing soft-phase coverage, the spherical segments of domes are filled first (12 vertices of the shell), then the cylindrical segments connecting the domes (30 edges) are invaded, and, ultimately, the 20 flat faces of the icosahedral shell tend to be occupied by the soft material. We present a detailed theoretical investigation of the first two stages of this invasion process and develop a model of morphological changes of the cone structure that permits noncircular cross sections. In conclusion, we discuss the biological relevance of some structures predicted from our calculations, in particular for the shape of viral capsids.",
  "Weak scaling of the contact distance between two fluctuating interfaces with system size.\nA pair of flat parallel surfaces, each freely diffusing along the direction of their separation, will eventually come into contact. If the shapes of these surfaces also fluctuate, then contact will occur when their centers-of-mass remain separated by a nonzero distance ℓ. An example of such a situation is the motion of interfaces between two phases at conditions of thermodynamic coexistence, and in particular the annihilation of domain wall pairs under periodic boundary conditions. Here we present a general approach to calculate the probability distribution of the contact distance ℓ and determine how its most likely value ℓ^{*} depends on the surfaces' lateral size L. Using the Edward-Wilkinson equation as a model for interfaces, we demonstrate that ℓ^{*} scales weakly with system size, i.e., the dependence of ℓ^{*} on L for both (1+1)- and (2+1)-dimensional interfaces is such that lim_{L→∞}(ℓ^{*}/L)=0. In particular, for (2+1)-dimensional interfaces ℓ^{*} is an algebraic function of logL, a result that is confirmed by computer simulations of slab-shaped domains formed under periodic boundary conditions. This weak scaling implies that such domains remain topologically intact until ℓ becomes very small compared to the lateral size of the interface, contradicting expectations from equilibrium thermodynamics.",
  "A new Drosophila model of Ubiquilin knockdown shows the effect of impaired proteostasis on locomotive and learning abilities.\nUbiquilin (UBQLN) plays a crucial role in cellular proteostasis through its involvement in the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy. Mutations in the UBQLN2 gene have been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ALS with frontotemporal lobar dementia (ALS/FTLD). Previous studies reported a key role for UBQLN in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanistic involvement of UBQLN in other neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. The genome of Drosophila contains a single UBQLN homolog (dUbqn) that shows high similarity to UBQLN1 and UBQLN2; therefore, the fly is a useful model for characterizing the role of UBQLN in vivo in neurological disorders affecting locomotion and learning abilities. We herein performed a phenotypic and molecular characterization of diverse dUbqn RNAi lines. We found that the depletion of dUbqn induced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and caused morphological defects in various tissues. Our results showed that structural defects in larval neuromuscular junctions, abdominal neuromeres, and mushroom bodies correlated with limited abilities in locomotion, learning, and memory. These results contribute to our understanding of the impact of impaired proteostasis in neurodegenerative diseases and provide a useful Drosophila model for the development of promising therapies for ALS and FTLD.",
  "Dodge and survive: Modeling the predatory nature of dodgeball.\nThe analysis of games and sports as complex systems can give insights into the dynamics of human competition and has been proven useful in soccer, basketball, and other professional sports. In this paper, we present a model for dodgeball, a popular sport in U.S. schools, and analyze it using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) compartmental model and stochastic agent-based game simulations. The ODE model reveals a rich landscape with different game dynamics occurring depending on the strategies used by the teams, which can in some cases be mapped to scenarios in competitive species models. Stochastic agent-based game simulations confirm and complement the predictions of the deterministic ODE models. In some scenarios, game victory can be interpreted as a noise-driven escape from the basin of attraction of a stable fixed point, resulting in extremely long games when the number of players is large. Using the ODE and agent-based models, we construct a strategy to increase the probability of winning.",
  "Nature to the natural rescue: Silencing microbial chats.\nCommunication is the sole means by which effective networking and co-existence is accomplished amongst living beings. Microbes have their own chit-chats. Science has overheard these microbial gossips and have concluded that these aren't just informal communications, but carefully coordinated signals that plan their effective strategies. Tracking one such signal molecule, N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL), led to a fundamental understanding to microbial quorum sensing (QS). Furtherance of research sought for ways to cut off communication between these virulent forms, so as to hinder their combinatorial attacks through quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs). A clear understanding of the inhibitors of these microbial communication systems is vital to destroy their networking and co-working. The current review, consolidates the solutions for QSIs offered from natural sources against these micro components, that are capable of slaughtering even nature's most fit entity-man. The applications of effective out sourcing of this QSI technologies and the need for development are discussed. The importance of silencing this microbial chatter to various aspects of human life and their implications are discussed and elaborated.",
  "Effects of a novel microtubule-depolymerizer on pro-inflammatory signaling in RAW264.7 macrophages.\nThe Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway is vital for immune system regulation and pro-inflammatory signaling. Many inflammatory disorders and diseases, including cancer, are linked to dysregulation of NF-κB signaling. When macrophages recognize the presence of a pathogen, the signaling pathway is activated, resulting in the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, to turn on pro-inflammatory genes. Here, we demonstrate the effects of a novel microtubule depolymerizer, NT-07-16, a polysubstituted pyrrole compound, on this process. Treatment with NT-07-16 decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. It appears that the reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators produced by the macrophages after exposure to NT-07-16 may be due to activities upstream of the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. NF-κB translocation occurs after its inhibitory protein, IκB-α is phosphorylated which signals for its degradation releasing NF-κB so it is free to move into the nucleus. Previous studies from other laboratories indicate that these processes are associated with the microtubule network. Our results show that exposure to the microtubule-depolymerizer, NT-07-16 reduces the phosphorylation of IκB-α and also decreases the association of NF-κB with tubulin which may affect the ability of NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory activity of NT-07-16 may be explained, at least in part, by alterations in these steps in the NF-κB signaling pathway leading to less NF-κB entering the nucleus and reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by the activated macrophages.",
  "Impact of electric charge and motion of water drops on the inception field strength of partial discharges.\nStrong electric fields may deform drops and induce their oscillation or motion on the substrate. Moreover, they can initiate partial discharges (PDs) because of the enhancement of the electric field in the vicinity of the three-phase contact lines. The partial discharges affect the drop spreading which can result in unusual drop shapes. In addition, the partial discharges can also deteriorate the surface properties of the substrate, e.g., of high-voltage composite insulators. In this study the occurrence of partial discharges due to stationary or oscillating sessile drops under the influence of an alternating electric field is investigated using a generic insulator model under well-defined conditions. Drops of a yield stress fluid (a gelatin-water mixture) are used to determine the PD inception field strength for stationary drop shapes. The influence of the volume as well as the distance between the individual drops for two drop configurations on the PD inception threshold is determined. The inception field strength of the partial discharges is measured for various drop volumes, drop charges, as well as for different resonance modes of drop oscillations. Besides the electrical measurement, the location of the partial discharges is optically determined by a UV camera. The detailed knowledge of the influencing factors of the partial discharges improves the understanding of the drop behavior under the impact of strong electric fields.",
  "First-principles calculation of the configurational energy density of states for a solid-state ion conductor with a variant of the Wang and Landau algorithm.\nIn this work, a variant of the Wang and Landau algorithm for calculation of the configurational energy density of states is proposed. The algorithm was developed for the purpose of using first-principles simulations, such as density functional theory, to calculate the partition function of disordered sublattices in crystal materials. The expensive calculations of first-principles methods make a parallel algorithm necessary for a practical computation of the configurational energy density of states within a supercell approximation of a solid-state material. The algorithm developed in this work is tested with the two-dimensional (2d) Ising model to bench mark the algorithm and to help provide insight for implementation to a materials science application. Tests with the 2d Ising model revealed that the algorithm has good performance compared to the original Wang and Landau algorithm and the 1/t algorithm, in particular the short iteration performance. A proof of convergence is presented within an adiabatic assumption, and the analysis is able to correctly predict the time dependence of the modification factor to the density of states. The algorithm was then applied to the lithium and lanthanum sublattice of the solid-state lithium ion conductor Li_{0.5}La_{0.5}TiO_{3}. This was done to help understand the disordered nature of the lithium and lanthanum. The results find, overall, that the algorithm performs very well for the 2d Ising model and that the results for Li_{0.5}La_{0.5}TiO_{3} are consistent with experiment while providing additional insight into the lithium and lanthanum ordering in the material. The primary result is that the lithium and lanthanum become more mixed between layers along the c axis for increasing temperature. In part, the simulation of the disordered Li_{0.5}La_{0.5}TiO_{3} system serves as a benchmark for what size systems are currently and in the near future practical to calculate with density functional theory methods.",
  "Time-resolved investigation of subnanosecond radiation from Al wire hybrid X pinches.\nK-shell x-ray spectra from Al wire hybrid X pinches have been studied using an x-ray streak camera with better than 0.1-ns time resolution together with a Focusing Spectrograph with Spatial Resolution (FSSR) spectrograph. High-intensity radiation with a continuumlike spectrum was observed in the subnanosecond initial phase of the x-ray pulse generated by the hybrid X pinch (HXP). The absence of spectral lines in this phase and the extremely small x-ray source size indicates the importance of radiative processes in the final phase implosion dynamics. Plasma parameters in the following phases of the HXP were determined from analysis of the line intensities. Point-projection radiography together with a slit-step wedge camera and an FSSR spectrograph without time resolution were used to show the number of radiation sources, and to give information on the time-integrated photon energy spectrum.",
  "Spironolactone voltammetric determination on renewable amalgam film electrode.\nIn this study a new high sensitive method of spironolactone (SP) determination is proposed using voltammetric technique. As the working electrode amalgam film silver based electrode (Hg(Ag)FE) was applied, that resulted in obtaining low limit of spironolactone detection, ex. for the preconcentration time 45&#8239;s obtained detection limit was 4.7&#183;10<sup>-9</sup>&#8239;mol&#8239;L<sup>-1</sup> (1.96&#183;10<sup>-6</sup>&#8239;g&#8239;L<sup>-1</sup>). The linear response of spironolactone signal on mercury film electrode was obtained in the range of concentration from 15&#183;10<sup>-9</sup> to 3.0&#183;10<sup>-6</sup>&#8239;mol&#8239;L<sup>-1</sup> and the obtained repeatability measured as RSD was very good, with the value of 2.0% (n&#8239;=&#8239;5; concentration 0.5&#183;10<sup>-6</sup>&#8239;mol&#8239;L<sup>-1</sup>). The proposed method was successfully applied and validated by studying the recovery in commercially available pharmaceutical formulations containing known amount of spironolactone.",
  "Behavioral thermoregulation in a small herbivore avoids direct UVB damage.\nDirect damage of increased solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) on organism fitness has attracted attention due to stratospheric ozone depletion. Although most ectotherms are not capable of detecting and avoiding solar UVB, they may avoid direct exposure to solar UVB via thermoregulation behavior. However, it is still not clear whether organisms are harmed by ambient UVB radiation before escaping to shaded microhabitats. In this study we used the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Hemiptera: Aphididae), to test whether sunlight-avoidance behavior was caused by heat stress rather than UVB, and whether behavioral thermoregulation in shaded microhabitats contributes to avoidance or reduction of direct UVB damage. Our results showed that S. avenae tended to inhabit exposed adaxial leaf surfaces in mid-May in Mongolia, but inhabited shaded leaf surfaces in mid-June, thereby avoiding strong sunlight. Heat exposure rather than solar UVB was the primary reason for such avoidance behavior. The average and extreme temperatures of shaded leaf surfaces were several degrees lower than sunlight-exposed surfaces at midday, suggesting that movement to shaded leaf surfaces represents a form of behavioral thermoregulation. Such responses occurred before UVB radiation reached harmful levels, and contributed to avoiding direct UVB damage. As future climate warming is expected to lead to harmful UVB radiation as well as increasing temperatures, this may represent a case where responses to one stressor inadvertently protect against the harmful effects of a different stressor.",
  "Non-Markovian majority-vote model.\nNon-Markovian dynamics pervades human activity and social networks and it induces memory effects and burstiness in a wide range of processes including interevent time distributions, duration of interactions in temporal networks, and human mobility. Here, we propose a non-Markovian majority-vote model (NMMV) that introduces non-Markovian effects in the standard (Markovian) majority-vote model (SMV). The SMV model is one of the simplest two-state stochastic models for studying opinion dynamics, and displays a continuous order-disorder phase transition at a critical noise. In the NMMV model we assume that the probability that an agent changes state is not only dependent on the majority state of his neighbors but it also depends on his age, i.e., how long the agent has been in his current state. The NMMV model has two regimes: the aging regime implies that the probability that an agent changes state is decreasing with his age, while in the antiaging regime the probability that an agent changes state is increasing with his age. Interestingly, we find that the critical noise at which we observe the order-disorder phase transition is a nonmonotonic function of the rate β of the aging (antiaging) process. In particular the critical noise in the aging regime displays a maximum as a function of β while in the antiaging regime displays a minimum. This implies that the aging/antiaging dynamics can retard/anticipate the transition and that there is an optimal rate β for maximally perturbing the value of the critical noise. The analytical results obtained in the framework of the heterogeneous mean-field approach are validated by extensive numerical simulations on a large variety of network topologies.",
  "Equilibration of sinusoidal modulation of temperature in linear and nonlinear chains.\nThe equilibration of sinusoidally modulated distribution of the kinetic temperature is analyzed in the β-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain with different degrees of nonlinearity and for different wavelengths of temperature modulation. Two different types of initial conditions are used to show that either one gives the same result as the number of realizations increases and that the initial conditions that are closer to the state of thermal equilibrium give faster convergence. The kinetics of temperature equilibration is monitored and compared to the analytical solution available for the linear chain in the continuum limit. The transition from ballistic to diffusive thermal conductivity with an increase in the degree of anharmonicity is shown. In the ballistic case, the energy equilibration has an oscillatory character with an amplitude decreasing in time, and in the diffusive case, it is monotonous in time. For smaller wavelength of temperature modulation, the oscillatory character of temperature equilibration remains for a larger degree of anharmonicity. For a given wavelength of temperature modulation, there is such a value of the anharmonicity parameter at which the temperature equilibration occurs most rapidly.",
  "Ion attachment rates and collection forces on dust particles in a plasma sheath with finite ion inertia and mobility.\nIon attachment and ion drag to dust particles near the edge of a nonthermal plasma sheath are of interest to better understand how particles become trapped in such sheath regions. While electron-particle collisions in plasmas and sheaths can often be described by orbital motion limited theory, quantification of ion transport about dust particles in collisional sheath regions requires a distinct modeling approach. In this work, the dimensionless ion attachment coefficients and dimensionless collection forces on negatively charged particles are calculated using ion trajectory models accounting for an external electric field in a collisional sheath, ion inertia, and finite ion mobility. By considering both ion inertia and finite ion mobility, results apply for ion transport from the fully collisional regime into a regime of intermediate collisionality. Ion collection forces are calculated in two related limits; first, the nondissipative limit, wherein the dimensionless collection force function coincides with the dimensionless attachment coefficient (anticipated in the collisionless regime), and second, a dissipative limit, wherein neutral gas collisions dissipate ion momentum, which strongly affects the resulting collection force (anticipated in the fully collisional regime). We show that ion motion about a charged particle can be parametrized by the ion Stokes number, which is the ratio of ion inertia to gas resistance to motion and dimensionless electric field strength (the external field strength normalized by the electric field at the particle surface). At intermediate Stokes numbers (10^{1}-10^{2}), ions adopt trajectories that are extremely sensitive to the initial ion-particle impact parameter. Plots of the resulting collision angle at fixed Stokes number and dimensionless field strength as a function of impact parameter contain multiple discontinuities. Nonetheless, we obtain smooth curves for the ion attachment rates and collection forces in both the nondissipative and fully dissipative limits. Increasing the ion Stokes number is found to significantly decrease the dimensionless ion attachment coefficients and ion collection forces in comparison to coefficients evaluated with expressions derived in the fully collisional limit. In all instances, including the dissipative limit, we find the ion collection force acts in the direction of ion migration. Neural network fits are utilized to parametrize the resulting attachment coefficients and ion collection forces, and we apply these fits to examine the charge levels on 1-μm radius particles in external fields in the 3×10^{2}-3×10^{3}Vm^{-1} range and pressures in the 5×10^{-1}-5×10^{1} Torr (66.7-6667 Pa) range. We find the charge level is strongly sensitive to both field strength and pressure in the plasma sheath, ranging from 6 × 10^{3} to 1.8 × 10^{4} over the conditions examined. Calculations are also used to demonstrate that the ion collection force can be sufficiently strong to trap particles not only close to the bottom electrode of a parallel-plate reactor, but also close to the top electrode, with a critical ion density required for trapping.",
  "Getting a handle on virtual tools: An examination of the neuronal activity associated with virtual tool use.\nTool use is associated with three visual streams-dorso-dorsal, ventro-dorsal, and ventral visual streams. These streams are involved in processing online motor planning, action semantics, and tool semantics features, respectively. Little is known about the way in which the brain represents virtual tools. To directly assess this question, a virtual tool paradigm was created that provided the ability to manipulate tool components in isolation of one another. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), adult participants performed a series of virtual tool manipulation tasks in which vision and movement kinematics of the tool were manipulated. Reaction time and hand movement direction were monitored while the tasks were performed. Functional imaging revealed that activity within all three visual streams was present, in a similar pattern to what would be expected with physical tool use. However, a previously unreported network of right-hemisphere activity was found including right inferior parietal lobule, middle and superior temporal gyri and supramarginal gyrus - regions well known to be associated with tool processing within the left hemisphere. These results provide evidence that both virtual and physical tools are processed within the same brain regions, though virtual tools recruit bilateral tool processing regions to a greater extent than physical tools.",
  "Making predictable unpredictable with style - Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence for the critical role of prosodic expectations in the perception of prominence in speech.\nPerceptual prominence of linguistic units such as words has been earlier connected to the concepts of predictability and attentional orientation. One hypothesis is that low-probability prosodic or lexical content is perceived as prominent due to the surprisal and high information value associated with the stimulus. However, the existing behavioral studies have used stimulus manipulations that follow or violate typical linguistic patterns present in the listeners' native language, i.e., assuming that the listeners have already established a model for acceptable prosodic patterns in the language. In the present study, we investigated whether prosodic expectations and the resulting subjective impression of prominence is affected by brief statistical adaptation to suprasegmental acoustic features in speech, also in the case where the prosodic patterns do not necessarily follow language-typical marking for prominence. We first exposed listeners to five minutes of speech with uneven distributions of falling and rising fundamental frequency (F0) trajectories on sentence-final words, and then tested their judgments of prominence on a set of new utterances. The results show that the probability of the F0 trajectory affects the perception of prominence, a less frequent F0 trajectory making a word more prominent independently of the absolute direction of F0 change. In the second part of the study, we conducted EEG-measurements on a set of new subjects listening to similar utterances with predominantly rising or falling F0 on sentence-final words. Analysis of the resulting event-related potentials (ERP) reveals a significant difference in N200 and N400 ERP-component amplitudes between standard and deviant prosody, again independently of the F0 direction and the underlying lexical content. Since N400 has earlier been associated with semantic processing of stimuli, this suggests that listeners implicitly track probabilities at the suprasegmental level and that predictability of a prosodic pattern during a word has an impact to the semantic processing of the word. Overall, the study suggests that prosodic markers for prominence are at least partially driven by the statistical structure of recently perceived speech, and therefore prominence perception could be based on statistical learning mechanisms similar to those observed in early word learning, but in this case operating at the level of suprasegmental acoustic features.",
  "Tat-enhanced delivery of the C terminus of HDAg-L inhibits assembly and secretion of hepatitis D virus.\nHepatitis D virus (HDV) contains a single-stranded circular RNA genome that encodes two forms of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), the small delta antigen (HDAg-S) and the large delta antigen (HDAg-L). The two proteins have an identical amino acid sequence, except that HDAg-L has a 19-amino-acid extension at the C terminus. The domain spanning amino acid residues 198-210 of the HDAg-L (HDAg-L(198-210)) contains a nuclear export signal (NES), which is important for the nuclear export of HDV ribonucleoprotein to the cytoplasm. In this study, we established a cell permeable TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein using an E. coli protein expression system, to determine its function during HDV infection. The cytotoxicity of the TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein was investigated using an MTT assay, while a GST pull-down assay revealed that the TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein interfered with the interaction between HDAg-L and clathrin heavy chain (CHC). In addition, the cellular distribution of HDAg-L, in the presence of HBsAg, was observed by immunofluorescence staining and the TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein was found to impede the nuclear export of HDAg-L. Furthermore, assembly of HDV virus-like particles (VLPs) was decreased by the expression of the TAT-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein. The TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein also inhibited virus particle assembly and HDV secretion in a mouse model. These results suggest that the TAT-HA-HDAg-L(198-210) fusion protein inhibits the nuclear export of HDAg-L and competes with the C terminus of HDAg-L for interaction with CHC, and may have potential as a therapeutic agent for HDV infection.",
  "Phase space structure and escape time dynamics in a Van der Waals model for exothermic reactions.\nWe study the phase space objects that control the transport in a classical Hamiltonian model for a chemical reaction. This model has been proposed to study the yield of products in an ultracold exothermic reaction. In this model, two features determine the evolution of the system: a Van der Waals force and a short-range force associated with the many-body interactions. In the previous work, small random periodic changes in the direction of the momentum were used to simulate the short-range many-body interactions. In the present work, random Gaussian bumps have been added to the Van der Waals potential energy to simulate the short-range effects between the particles in the system. We compare both variants of the model and explain their differences and similarities from a phase space perspective. To visualize the structures that direct the dynamics in the phase space, we construct a natural Lagrangian descriptor for Hamiltonian systems based on the Maupertuis action S_{0}=∫_{q_{i}}^{q_{f}}p·dq.",
  "Static interface profiles for contact lines on an elastic membrane with the Willmore energy.\nWe consider a fluid interface in contact with an elastic membrane and study the static profiles of the interface and the membrane. Equilibrium conditions are derived by minimizing the total energy of the system with volume constraints. The total energy consists of surface energies and the Willmore energy; the latter penalizes the bending of the membrane. It is found that, while the membrane is locally flat at the contact line with the contact angle satisfying the Young-Dupré equation, the gradient of the mean curvature of the membrane exhibits a jump across the contact line. This jump balances the surface tension of the fluid interface in the normal direction of the membrane. Asymptotic solutions are obtained for two-dimensional systems in the limits as the reduced bending modulus ν tends to +∞ and 0, respectively. In the stiff limit as ν→+∞, the leading-order solution is given by that of a droplet sitting on a rigid substrate with the contact angle satisfying the Young-Dupré equation; in contrast, in the soft limit as ν→0, a transition layer appears near the contact line and the interfaces have constant curvatures in the outer region with apparent contact angles obeying Neumann's law. These solutions are validated by numerical experiments.",
  "Kinetics of domain growth and aging in a two-dimensional off-lattice system.\nWe have used molecular dynamics simulations for a comprehensive study of phase separation in a two-dimensional single-component off-lattice model where particles interact through the Lennard-Jones potential. Via state-of-the-art methods we have analyzed simulation data on structure, growth, and aging for nonequilibrium evolutions in the model. These data were obtained following quenches of well-equilibrated homogeneous configurations, with density close to the critical value, to various temperatures inside the miscibility gap, having vapor-\"liquid\" as well as vapor-\"solid\" coexistence. For the vapor-liquid phase separation we observe that ℓ, the average domain length, grows with time (t) as t^{1/2}, a behavior that has connection with hydrodynamics. At low-enough temperature, a sharp crossover of this time dependence to a much slower, temperature-dependent, growth is identified within the timescale of our simulations, implying \"solid\"-like final state of the high-density phase. This crossover is, interestingly, accompanied by strong differences in domain morphology and other structural aspects between the two situations. For aging, we have presented results for the order-parameter autocorrelation function. This quantity exhibits data collapse with respect to ℓ/ℓ_{w}, ℓ, and ℓ_{w} being the average domain lengths at times t and t_{w} (≤t), respectively, the latter being the age of a system. Corresponding scaling function follows a power-law decay: ∼(ℓ/ℓ_{w})^{-λ} for t≫t_{w}. The decay exponent λ, for the vapor-liquid case, is accurately estimated via the application of an advanced finite-size scaling method. The obtained value is observed to satisfy a bound.",
  "Anti-leptin receptor antibodies strengthen leptin biofunction in growing chickens.\nAntibodies against the extracellular domains of the chicken leptin receptor were used to study the biological function of leptin in growing chickens. Both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-LEPR antibodies were administered intramuscularly to 30-d-old Chinese indigenous Gushi pullets. Both antibody preparations increased feed intake for 6 h after injection and reduced plasma concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, and both high- and low-density lipoproteins. The antibody treatments also upregulated agouti-related peptide and neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus and downregulated proopiomelanocortin, melanocortin 4 receptor, and leptin receptor. The treatments also upregulated leptin receptor, acetyl CoA carboxylase beta, and acyl-CoA oxidase in the liver, abdominal fat, and breast muscle and downregulated sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and fatty acid synthase. Furthermore, even though the anti-leptin receptor antibodies failed to affect leptin receptor signaling transduction when administered alone, they did augment the induction of leptin receptor signaling transduction by leptin. These results demonstrate that antibodies against the extracellular domains of leptin-specific receptor enhance, but do not mimic, the ability of leptin to activate receptors. Furthermore, the enhanced leptin bioactivity observed after the intramuscular injection of anti-LEPR antibodies confirmed the occurrence of de novo leptin in the peripheral tissues and blood of treated chickens.",
  "Mapping the Ca2+ -dependent binding of an invertebrate homolog of protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 2 to the small EF-hand protein, calsensin.\nThe EF-hand family of calcium-binding proteins regulates cellular signal transduction events via calcium-dependent interactions with target proteins. Here, we show that the COOH-terminal tail of the leech homolog of protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 2 (PP4-R2) interacts with the small neuronal EF-hand calcium-binding protein, Calsensin, in a calcium-dependent manner. Using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and chemical shift perturbations we have identified and mapped the residues of Calsensin that form a binding surface for PP4-R2. We show that the binding groove is formed primarily of discontinuous hydrophobic residues located in helix 1, the hinge region, and helix 4 of the unicornate-type four helix structure of Calsensin. The findings suggest the possibility that calcium-dependent modulation of phosphatase complexes through interactions with small calcium-binding proteins may be a general mechanism for regulation of signal transduction pathways.",
  "Spectroscopic analysis in molecular simulations with discretized Wiener-Khinchin theorem for Fourier-Laplace transformation.\nThe Wiener-Khinchin theorem for the Fourier-Laplace transformation (WKT-FLT) provides a robust method to obtain the single-side Fourier transforms of arbitrary time-domain relaxation functions (or autocorrelation functions). Moreover, by combining an on-the-fly algorithm with the WKT-FLT, the numerical calculations of various complex spectroscopic data in a wide frequency range become significantly more efficient. However, the discretized WKT-FLT equation, obtained simply by replacing the integrations with the discrete summations, always produces two artifacts in the frequency-domain relaxation function. In addition, the artifacts become more apparent in the frequency-domain response function converted from the relaxation function. We find the sources of these artifacts that are associated with the discretization of the WKT-FLT equation. Taking these sources into account, we derive discretized WKT-FLT equations designated for both the frequency-domain relaxation and response functions with the artifacts removed. The use of the discretized WKT-FLT equations with the on-the-fly algorithm is illustrated by a flow chart. We also give application examples for the wave-vector-dependent dynamic susceptibility in an isotropic amorphous polyethylene and the frequency-domain response functions of the orientation vectors in an n-alkane crystal.",
  "Comparison among different \"revealers\" in the study of accelerated blood clearance phenomenon.\nThe markers are the \"revealers\" of accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon. PEGylated nanocarriers labeled with various markers have been used to explore the mechanism of ABC. However, different markers were labeled on different nanocarriers, and the influence of different markers on ABC phenomenon is questionable. In this study, tocopheryl nicotinate (TN), N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, triethylammonium salt (NBD-DPPE), and 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetra-methylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR) were selected as markers. ABC index<sub>(0-30min)</sub> was used as an evaluation indicator to reveal ABC phenomenon after repeated injections of PEGylated emulsions (PEs) in Wistar rats. No significant difference was observed in ABC index<sub>(0-30min)</sub> of PE labeled with the three markers (P&gt;0.05), suggesting that the results of previous studies using these markers were comparable and interchangeable. Of the three markers, TN required tedious analytical method and showed proliferative effect on liver cells, while NBD-DPPE fluorescence was easily interfered by tissues and its phospholipid composition affected ABC analysis. On the contrary, DiR was deemed superior due to its near-infrared fluorescence, high-sensitivity, and convenient analytical detection.",
  "Quenching to fix metastable states in models of prebiotic chemistry.\nFor prebiotic chemistry to succeed in producing a starting metastable, autocatalytic and reproducing system subject to evolutionary selection it must satisfy at least two apparently contradictory requirements: Because such systems are rare, a search among vast numbers of molecular combinations must take place naturally, requiring rapid rearrangement and breaking of covalent bonds. But once a relevant system is found, such rapid disruption and rearrangement would be very likely to destroy the system before much evolution could take place. In this paper we explore the possibility, using a model developed previously, that the search process could occur under different environmental conditions than the subsequent fixation and growth of a lifelike chemical system. We use the example of a rapid change in temperature to illustrate the effect and refer to the rapid change as a \"quench\"borrowing terminology from study of the physics and chemistry of glass formation. The model study shows that interrupting a high-temperature nonequilibrium state with a rapid quench to lower temperatures can substantially increase the probability of producing a chemical state with lifelike characteristics of nonequilibrium metastability, internal dynamics and exponential population growth in time. Previously published data on the length distributions of proteomes of prokaryotes may be consistent with such an idea and suggest a prebiotic high-temperature \"search\" phase near the boiling point of water. A rapid change in pH could have a similar effect. We discuss possible scenarios on early Earth which might have allowed frequent quenches of the sort considered here to have occurred. The models show a strong dependence of the effect on the number of chemical monomers available for bond formation.",
  "Quantum manifestations of homogeneous and inhomogeneous oscillation suppression states.\nWe study the quantum manifestations of homogeneous and inhomogeneous oscillation suppression states in coupled identical quantum oscillators. We consider quantum van der Pol oscillators coupled via weighted mean-field diffusive coupling and, using the formalism of open quantum systems, we show that, depending on the coupling and the density of mean-field, two types of quantum amplitude death occurs, namely, squeezed and nonsqueezed quantum amplitude death. Surprisingly, we find that the inhomogeneous oscillation suppression state (or the oscillation death state) does not occur in the quantum oscillators in the classical limit. However, in the deep quantum regime we discover an oscillation death-like state which is manifested in the phase space through the symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the Wigner function. Our results also hint toward the possibility of the transition from quantum amplitude death to oscillation death state through the \"quantum\" Turing-type bifurcation. We believe that the observation of quantum oscillation death state will deepen our knowledge of symmetry-breaking dynamics in the quantum domain.",
  "Tighter thermodynamic bound on the speed limit in systems with unidirectional transitions.\nWe consider a general discrete state-space system with both unidirectional and bidirectional links. In contrast to bidirectional links, there is no reverse transition along the unidirectional links. Herein, we first compute the statistical length and the thermodynamic cost function for transitions in the probability space, highlighting contributions from total, environmental, and resetting (unidirectional) entropy production. Then we derive the thermodynamic bound on the speed limit to connect two distributions separated by a finite time, showing the effect of the presence of unidirectional transitions. Uncertainty relationships can be found for the temporal first and second moments of the average resetting entropy production. We derive simple expressions in the limit of slow unidirectional transition rates. Finally, we present a refinement of the thermodynamic bound by means of an optimization procedure. We numerically investigate these results on systems that stochastically reset with constant and periodic resetting rate.",
  "Observation of stochastic resonance in a liquid-crystal light valve with optical feedback induced by colored noise in the driving voltage.\nStochastic resonance is a noise phenomenon that benefits applications such as pattern formation, neural systems, microelectromechanical systems, and image processing. This study experimentally clarifies that the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules was switched between two stable positions when stochastic resonance was induced by colored noises in a liquid crystal light valve with optical feedback. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and dichotomous noises were used for colored noise, and the noise was applied to the drive voltage of the liquid crystal light valve. The signal-to-noise ratio was measured with respect to changes in the noise type, noise intensity, and autocorrelation time of the noise. It was found that typical stochastic resonance was observed with a noise autocorrelation time of approximately 20 ms or more for both noise types, and dichotomous noise further enhanced the stochastic resonance compared to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This suggests that it is possible to maximize stochastic resonance in a liquid crystal light valve by optimizing the conditions of colored noise.",
  "Heat rectification on the XX chain.\nIn order to better understand the minimal ingredients for thermal rectification, we perform a detailed investigation of a simple spin chain, namely, the open XX model with a Lindblad dynamics involving global dissipators. We use a Jordan-Wigner transformation to derive a mathematical formalism to compute the heat currents and other properties of the steady state. We have rigorous results to prove the occurrence of thermal rectification even for slightly asymmetrical chains. Interestingly, we describe cases where the rectification does not decay to zero as we increase the system size, that is, the rectification remains finite in the thermodynamic limit. We also describe some numerical results for more asymmetrical chains. The presence of thermal rectification in this simple model indicates that the phenomenon is of general occurrence in quantum spin systems.",
  "Far-field flow and drift due to particles and organisms in density-stratified fluids.\nIn the limit of small inertia, stratification, and advection of density, Ardekani and Stocker [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 084502 (2010)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.105.084502] derived the flow due to a point-force and force-dipole placed in a linearly density-stratified fluid. In this limit, these flows also represent the far-field flow due to a towed particle and a neutrally buoyant swimming organism in a stratified fluid. Here, we derive these two far-field flows in the limit of small inertia, stratification but at large advection of density. In both these limits, the flow in a stratified fluid decays rapidly and has closed streamlines but certain symmetries present at small advection are lost at large advection. To illustrate the application of these flows, we use them to calculate the drift induced by a towed drop and a swimming organism, as a means to quantify the mixing caused by them. The drift induced in a stratified fluid is less than that in the homogeneous fluid. A towed drop induces a large drift relative to its own volume at small advection while it induces at least an order of magnitude smaller drift at large advection. On the other hand, a swimming organism induces a large partial drift as compared with its own volume irrespective of the magnitude of advection, unless the stresslet exerted by the swimmer is small. These results are useful in understanding the stratification effects on the drift-based contributions to mixing.",
  "Renormalization of stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise using effective potential methods.\nWe present a method to renormalize stochastic differential equations subjected to multiplicative noise. The method is based on the widely used concept of effective potential in high-energy physics and has already been successfully applied to the renormalization of stochastic differential equations subjected to additive noise. We derive a general formula for the one-loop effective potential of a single ordinary stochastic differential equation (with arbitrary interaction terms) subjected to multiplicative Gaussian noise (provided the noise satisfies a certain normalization condition). To illustrate the usefulness (and limitations) of the method, we use the effective potential to renormalize a toy chemical model based on a simplified Gray-Scott reaction. In particular, we use it to compute the scale dependence of the toy model's parameters (in perturbation theory) when subjected to a Gaussian power-law noise with short time correlations.",
  "Height distribution and orientation of colloidal dumbbells near a wall.\nGeometric confinement strongly influences the behavior of microparticles in liquid environments. However, to date, nonspherical particle behaviors close to confining boundaries, even as simple as planar walls, remain largely unexplored. Here, we measure the height distribution and orientation of colloidal dumbbells above walls by means of digital in-line holographic microscopy. We find that while larger dumbbells are oriented almost parallel to the wall, smaller dumbbells of the same material are surprisingly oriented at preferred angles. We determine the total height-dependent force acting on the dumbbells by considering gravitational effects and electrostatic particle-wall interactions. Our modeling reveals that at specific heights both net forces and torques on the dumbbells are simultaneously below the thermal force and energy, respectively, which makes the observed orientations possible. Our results highlight the rich near-wall dynamics of nonspherical particles and can further contribute to the development of quantitative frameworks for arbitrarily shaped microparticle dynamics in confinement.",
  "Oropouche fever, an emergent disease from the Americas.\nOropouche virus is the aetiological agent of Oropouche fever, a zoonotic disease mainly transmitted by midges of the species Culicoides paraensis. Although the virus was discovered in 1955, more attention has been given recently to both the virus and the disease due to outbreaks of Oropouche fever in different areas of Brazil and Peru. Serological studies in human and wild mammals have also found Oropouche virus in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador. Several mammals act as reservoirs of the disease, although the sylvatic cycle of Oropouche virus remains to be assessed properly. Oropouche fever lacks key symptoms to be differentiated from other arboviral febrile illnesses from the Americas. Sporadic cases of aseptic meningitis have also been described with good prognosis. Habitat loss can increase the likelihood of Oropouche virus emergence in the short-term in South America.",
  "Recovering Gardner restacking with purely diffusive operations.\nThe maximum particle kinetic energy that can be extracted from an initial six-dimensional phase space distribution motivates the concept of free or available energy. The free energy depends on the allowed operations that can be performed. A key concept underlying the theoretical treatment of plasmas is the Gardner free energy, where the exchange of the contents of equal phase volumes is allowed. A second free energy concept is the diffusive free energy, in which the contents of volumes are instead averaged. For any finite discretization of phase space, the diffusive free energy is known to be less than the Gardner free energy. However, despite the apparent fundamental differences between these free energies, it is demonstrated here that the Gardner free energy may be recovered from the continuous limit of the diffusive free energy, leading to the surprise that macroscopic phase-space conservation can be achieved by ostensibly entropy-producing microscopic operations.",
  "Equivalence between condensation and boiling in a Lennard-Jones fluid.\nCondensation and boiling are phase transitions highly relevant to industry, geology, and atmospheric science. These phase transitions are initiated by the nucleation of a drop in a supersaturated vapor and of a bubble in an overstretched liquid, respectively. The surface tension between both phases, liquid and vapor, is a key parameter in the development of such nucleation stage. Whereas the surface tension can be readily measured for a flat interface, there are technical and conceptual limitations to obtain it for the curved interface of the nucleus. On the technical side, it is quite difficult to observe a critical nucleus in experiments. From a conceptual point of view, the interfacial free energy depends on the choice of the dividing surface, being the surface of tension the one relevant for nucleation. We bypass the technical limitation by performing simulations of a Lennard-Jones fluid where we equilibrate critical nuclei (both drops and bubbles). Regarding the conceptual hurdle, we find the relevant cluster size by searching the radius that correctly predicts nucleation rates and nucleation free energy barriers when combined with Classical Nucleation Theory. With such definition of the cluster size we find the same value of the surface tension for drops and bubbles of a given radius. Thus, condensation and boiling can be viewed as two sides of the same coin. Finally, we combine the data coming from drops and bubbles to obtain, via two different routes, estimates of the Tolman length, a parameter that allows describing the curvature dependence of the surface tension in a theoretical framework.",
  "Polymorphisms in the canine IL7R 3'UTR are associated with thymic output in Labrador retriever dogs and influence post-transcriptional regulation by microRNA 185.\nInterleukin-7 (IL-7) and its receptor (IL-7R) are essential for T cell development in the thymus, and changes in the IL-7/IL-7R pathway have been implicated in age-associated thymic involution which results in a reduction of naïve T cell output. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IL7 and IL7R genetic variation and thymic output in dogs. No single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the canine IL7 gene, but a number were present in the canine IL7R gene. Polymorphisms in the IL7R exon 8 and 3'UTR were found to be associated with signal joint T cell receptor excision circle (sj-TREC) values (a biomarker of thymic output) in young and geriatric Labrador retrievers. Additionally, one of the SNPs in the IL7R 3'UTR (SNP 14 c.1371 + 446 A > C) was found to cause a change in the seed-binding site for microRNA 185 which, a luciferase reporter assay demonstrated, caused changes in post-transcriptional regulation, and therefore might be capable of influencing IL-7R expression. The research findings suggest a genetic link between IL7R genotype and thymic output in dogs, which might impact on immune function as these animals age and provide further evidence of the involvement of IL-7/IL-7R pathway in age-associated thymic involution.",
  "Stochastic evolutionary dynamics of trust games with asymmetric parameters.\nTrusting in others and reciprocating that trust with trustworthy actions are crucial to successful and prosperous societies. The trust game has been widely used to quantitatively study trust and trustworthiness, involving a sequential exchange between an investor and a trustee. Deterministic evolutionary game theory predicts no trust and no trustworthiness, whereas the behavioral experiments with the one-shot anonymous trust game show that people substantially trust and respond trustworthily. To explain these discrepancies, previous works often turn to additional mechanisms, which are borrowed from other games such as the prisoner's dilemma. Although these mechanisms lead to the evolution of trust and trustworthiness to an extent, the optimal or the most common strategy often involves no trustworthiness. In this paper, we study the impact of asymmetric demographic parameters (e.g., different population sizes) on game dynamics of the trust game. We show that, in a weak-mutation limit, stochastic evolutionary dynamics with the asymmetric parameters can lead to the evolution of high trust and high trustworthiness without any additional mechanisms in well-mixed finite populations. Even full trust and near full trustworthiness can be the most common strategies. These results are qualitatively different from those of the previous works. Our results thereby demonstrate rich evolutionary dynamics of the asymmetric trust game.",
  "Hybrid stimulated Raman scattering-two-plasmon decay instability and 3/2 harmonic in steep-gradient femtosecond plasmas.\nWe numerically study interaction of a very intense (I∼10^{17} to 5×10^{19}W/cm^{2}) femtosecond obliquely incident p-polarized laser pulse with a steep-gradient (L∼λ) plasma, i.e., within the conditions typical for modern experiments. It is shown that the hybrid stimulated Raman scattering-two-plasmon decay instability develops near the quarter-critical density surface and plays the dominant role for the plasma waves' excitation and energy absorption. The plasmons are excited as two wave packets confined near this surface with very wide ≈ω_{0}/c spatial spectra along its normal. Hence, phase-matching conditions for the 3/2 harmonic generation are fulfilled immediately and include the mechanism coming from the high harmonics of plasma waves. This mechanism has been proved experimentally by observing an additional 3/2 harmonic beam.",
  "Glycine-rich loop encompassing active site at interface of hexameric M. tuberculosis Eis protein contributes to its structural stability and activity.\nRvEis is a crucial thermostable hexameric aminoglycoside acetyltransferase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, overexpression of which confers Kanamycin resistance in clinical strains. The thermostability associated with hexameric RvEis is important for the enhanced intracellular survival of mycobacteria. However, the structural determinants responsible for its thermal stability remain unexplored. In this study, we have assessed the role of glycines of conserved glycine-rich motif (G<sup>123</sup>GIYG<sup>127</sup>) present at the oligomeric interface in the hydrophobic core of RvEis in sustenance of its structural stability, oligomerization and functional activity. Substitution of glycines to alanine (G123A/G127A) result in significant decrease in melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>), reduction in the oligomerization with concomitant increase in the monomeric form and higher susceptibility towards the denaturants like GdmCl and urea relative to wild type. G123A/G127A mutant displayed lower catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) and is completely inactive at 60&#8239;&#176;C. ANS binding assay and the complete dissociation of hexameric complex into monomers at lower concentration of urea in G123A/G127A relative to wtRvEis suggests that altered hydrophobic environment could be the reason for its instability. In sum, these results demonstrate the role of G<sup>123</sup>GIYG<sup>127</sup> motif in structural stability and activity of RvEis.",
  "Roll Compaction/Dry Granulation of Dibasic Calcium Phosphate Anhydrous-Does the Morphology of the Raw Material Influence the Tabletability of Dry Granules?\nThe influence of raw material particle morphology on the tabletabilty of dry granules was investigated. Therefore, dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous was used as a model material. One milled grade, 2 agglomerated grades with different porosities, and a functionalized structure, that is, an agglomerate formed by very small primary particles, were included. Particle size, density, and specific surface area of raw materials were measured. The starting materials and 2 fractions of dry granules were compressed to tablets. The tabletability of granules was compared to that of the powders and the influence of specific compaction force, granule size, and lubrication on tablet tensile strength was evaluated. All materials showed a loss in tabletability induced by a previous compaction step but to a varying extent. Only in case of the functionalized calcium phosphate morphology, this effect depended on the specific compaction force. In contrast to the other materials, the tabletability of functionalized calcium phosphate was influenced by the granule size. This effect was not related to an overlubrication as internal and external lubrication resulted in similar tensile strengths. A clear influence of the particle morphology on tablet strength was demonstrated by the study. The functionalized structure showed aspects of a more plastic deformation behavior.

  "Role of Solvent Selection on Crystal Habit of 5-Aminosalicylic Acid-Combined Experimental and Computational Approach.\nMany active pharmaceutical ingredients exhibit a needle-like (acicular) crystal habit, which can significantly complicate their downstream processing. In this study, the acicular crystal habit of a model active pharmaceutical ingredient, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), was modified by addition of selected organic solvents to the typical aqueous crystallization process. 5-ASA was crystallized by a pH shift from 7.5-8 to 4 in the presence of methanol, acetonitrile, acetone, tetramethylurea, tetrahydrofuran or dimethyl sulfoxide at 25% v/v, or butanol at 9% v/v. Changes to the experimentally observed crystal habit are rationalized by considering adsorption energy calculations for the solvent molecules onto the morphologically important crystal faces. The crystal habit was influenced most significantly by organic solvents containing a good H-bond acceptor atom, particularly oxygen in acetone, tetramethylurea, tetrahydrofuran, and dimethyl sulfoxide. Such solvents have strongly stabilizing adsorption energies onto the fast-growing crystal faces, and their presence in solution thereby serves to modify the acicular habit of 5-ASA. The developed knowledge base on crystal interface-solvent interactions can form a basis for further engineering of an optimal crystal habit for 5-ASA.",
  "Heaps of sand in flows within a split-bottom Couette cell.\nIn this paper, we study the flow of angular grains in a split-bottom Couette cell. Grains departing from a spherical shape result in collective flow fields that form a heap on the free surface. Here we extend on previous observations in split-bottom cells, exploring a wider range of flows within the inertial regime and finding a richness collection of behaviours. Surface height profiles and velocity profiles are accurately measured with digital image analysis. These measurements allow the characterization of the flow regimes within the cell and the heap morphology. We show that the known flow regimes in split-bottom geometries, like the universal and wall-collapsed regimes, can also be observed in moderately high inertial flows, extending the range for studying universal shear banding. The heap morphology is amplified by the flow inertia, with a partial collapse when the cell comes to a halt. Moreover, at high angular velocities, flows under low confinement will spread radially outwards, while flows under high confinement will develop localized particle ejections. Our results complement the observation of free-surface deformations of flows of nonspherical grains. These observations suggest a need for considering deformable free surface boundary conditions in the simulation of angular grains during shear, with repercussions in the characterization and prediction of natural mass flows.",
  "Cellular Pharmacokinetic Model-Based Analysis of Genistein, Glyceollin, and MK-571 Effects on 5 (and 6)-Carboxy-2',7'-Dichloroflourescein Disposition in Caco-2 Cells.\nPharmacokinetic modeling was used to describe 5 (and 6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichloroflourescein (CDF) disposition in Caco-2 cells following CDF or CDFDA (CDF diacetate) dosing. CDF transcellular flux was modeled by simple passive diffusion. CDFDA dosing models were based on simultaneous fitting of CDF levels in apical, basolateral, and intracellular compartments. Predicted CDF efflux was 50% higher across the apical versus the basolateral membrane. This difference was similar following apical and basolateral CDFDA dosing, despite intracellular levels being 3-fold higher following basolateral dosing, thus supporting nonsaturable CDF efflux kinetics. A 3-compartment catenary model with intracellular CDFDA hydrolysis described CDF disposition. This model predicted that apical CDF efflux was not altered in the presence of MK-571, and that basolateral membrane clearance was enhanced to account for reduced intracellular CDF in the presence of this multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) inhibitor. Similar effects were predicted for glyceollin, while genistein exposure had no predicted effects on CDF efflux. These modulator effects are discussed in the context of model predicted intracellular CDF concentrations relative to reports of CDF affinity (measured by K<sub>m</sub>) for MRP2 and MRP3. This model-based analysis confirms the complexity of efflux kinetics and suggests that other transporters may have contributed to CDF efflux.",
  "The global role for Cdc13 and Yku70 in preventing telomere resection across the genome.\nYeast Cdc13 protein (related to human CTC1) maintains telomere stability by preventing 5'-3' end resection. While Cdc13 and Yku70/Yku80 proteins appear to prevent excessive resection, their combined contribution to maintenance of telomere ends across the genome and their relative roles at specific ends of different chromosomes have not been addressable because Cdc13 and Yku70/Yku80 double mutants are sickly. Using our PFGE-shift approach where large resected molecules have slower pulse field gel electrophoresis mobilities, along with methods for maintaining viable double mutants, we address end-resection on most chromosomes as well as telomere end differences. In this global approach to looking at ends of most chromosomes, we identify chromosomes with 1-end resections and end-preferences. We also identify chromosomes with resection at both ends, previously not possible. 10-20% of chromosomes exhibit PFGE-shift when cdc13-1 cells are switched to restrictive temperature (37 °C). In yku70Δ cdc13-1 mutants, there is a telomere resection \"storm\" with approximately half the chromosomes experiencing at least 1-end resection, ∼10 kb/telomere, due to exonuclease1 and many exhibiting 2-end resection. Unlike for random internal chromosome breaks, resection of telomere ends is not coordinated. Telomere restitution at permissive temperature is rapid (<1 h) in yku70Δ cdc13-1 cells. Surprisingly, survival can be high although strain background dependent. Given large amount of resected telomeres, we examined associated proteins. Up to 90% of cells have ≥1 Rfa1 (RPA) focus and 60% have multiple foci when ∼30-40 telomeres/cell are resected. The ends are dispersed in the nucleus suggesting wide distribution of resected telomeres across nuclear space. The previously reported Rad52 nuclear centers of repair for random DSBs also appear in cells with many resected telomere ends, suggesting a Rad52 commonality to the organization of single strand ends and/or limitation on interactions of single-strand ends with Rad52.",
  "Prognostic values of excision repair cross-complementing genes mRNA expression in ovarian cancer patients.\nExcision repair cross-complementing (ERCC) genes, key components of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, are regarded as crucial factors for DNA repair capacity. Previous studies have investigated prognostic values of ERCC genes in a number of malignancies. However, the relationship between ERCC genes and prognosis of ovarian cancer patients remains controversial. Therefore, in the current study, we systematically analyze the prognostic values of ERCC genes in ovarian cancer by the Kaplan-Meier plotter, which includes updated gene expression data and survival information of 1656 ovarian cancer patients. Our results showed that high expression of ERCC1 and ERCC8 mRNA was related to a worse overall survival among ovarian cancer patients, especially in late stage and poor differentiation serous ovarian patients. Increased ERCC4 mRNA expression indicated a better overall survival among serous ovarian cancer patients. The other ERCC genes were uncorrelated with prognosis in ovarian cancer. These results indicate that some ERCC genes have critical prognostic values in ovarian cancer.",
  "Collisional ionization and recombination in degenerate plasmas beyond the free-electron-gas approximation.\nOne of the most successful ways to model the multitude of electron and photon processes in plasmas is the approach used in collisional radiative (CR) codes. The accuracy of CR codes depends largely on the accuracy of the rates of each process. These rates are generally well approximated in hot, classical plasmas. However, in degenerate plasmas quantum effects can influence these rates and must be accounted for. Previous approaches have developed corrections to the classical rates using the free-electron-gas (FEG) approximation. Here, we use electronic structures beyond the FEG approximation and show how the collisional rates are affected by degeneracy in aluminum and iron plasmas. We find that the FEG is a good approximation for aluminum, whereas more complex electronic structures that include d orbitals, such as iron, deviate from the FEG approximation. This results in different degeneracy corrections to the collisional rates relative to those for the FEG. Although the general trend of the corrections to degenerate plasmas is captured by assuming an FEG, we show that more complex electronic structures can result in deviations, even outside the degenerate regime. This study further advances the treatment of free-electron quantum effects in collisional radiative models.",
  "Fokker-Planck equation for Coulomb relaxation and wave-particle diffusion: Spectral solution and the stability of the Kappa distribution to Coulomb collisions.\nThe present paper considers the time evolution of a charged test particle of mass m in a constant temperature heat bath of a second charged particle of mass M. The time dependence of the distribution function of the test particles is given by a Fokker-Planck equation with a diffusion coefficient for Coulomb collisions as well as a diffusion coefficient for wave-particle interactions. For the mass ratio m/M→0, the steady distribution is a Kappa distribution which has been employed in space physics to fit observed particle energy spectra. The time dependence of the distribution functions with some initial value is expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the linear Fokker-Planck operator and also interpreted with the transformation to a Schrödinger equation. We also consider the explicit time dependence of the distribution function with a discretization of the Fokker-Planck equation. We study the stability of the Kappa distribution to Coulomb collisions.",
  "Performance of the odour span task is not impaired following inactivations of parietal cortex in rats.\nWorking memory (WM) is the ability to temporarily store information for use and manipulation. Working memory is thought to depend on a distributed set of higher cortical areas including the prefrontal and parietal cortex in primates while relatively little research has been conducted in rodents to elucidate the exact role of the parietal cortex (PC) in WM, particularly in relation to the construct of WM capacity. Previous work in our lab demonstrates that performance of the odour span task (OST), an olfactory incremental delayed nonmatching-to-sample task, relies on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, the effects of inactivating the PC on the OST have not been studied. Therefore, the present experiment assessed the effects of inactivating the PC with the GABA receptor agonists muscimol/baclofen on performance of the OST. Infusions of muscimol/baclofen did not disrupt working memory performance, assessed by the mean number of odours each rat could remember before making an error on each day of testing. In contrast, performance of a positive control task, spontaneous cross-modal object recognition, was impaired by inactivating the PC. These results suggest that performance of the OST does not depend on the PC in rats. Our results are notable given past research demonstrating the importance of the parietal cortex for attentional processes and working memory in other tasks.",
  "Noisy signal propagation and amplification in phenotypic transition cascade of colonic cells.\nLike genes and proteins, cells can use biochemical networks to sense and process information. The differentiation of the cell state in colonic crypts forms a typical unidirectional phenotypic transitional cascade, in which stem cells differentiate into the transit-amplifying cells (TACs), and TACs continue to differentiate into fully differentiated cells. In order to quantitatively describe the relationship between the noise of each compartment and the amplification of signals, the gain factor is introduced, and the gain-fluctuation relation is obtained by using the linear noise approximation of the master equation. Through the simulation of these theoretical formulas, the characters of noise propagation and amplification are studied. It is found that the transmitted noise is an important part of the total noise in each downstream cell. Therefore, a small number of downstream cells can only cause its small inherent noise, but the total noise may be very large due to the transmitted noise. The influence of the transmitted noise may be the indirect cause of colon cancer. In addition, the total noise of the downstream cells always has a minimum value. As long as a reasonable value of the gain factor is selected, the number of cells in colonic crypts will be controlled within the normal range. This may be a good method to intervene the uncontrollable growth of tumor cells and effectively control the deterioration of colon cancer.",
  "Taming the diffusion approximation through a controlling-factor WKB method.\nThe diffusion approximation (DA) is widely used in the analysis of stochastic population dynamics, from population genetics to ecology and evolution. The DA is an uncontrolled approximation that assumes the smoothness of the calculated quantity over the relevant state space and fails when this property is not satisfied. This failure becomes severe in situations where the direction of selection switches sign. Here we employ the WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) large-deviations method, which requires only the logarithm of a given quantity to be smooth over its state space. Combining the WKB scheme with asymptotic matching techniques, we show how to derive the diffusion approximation in a controlled manner and how to produce better approximations, applicable for much wider regimes of parameters. We also introduce a scalable (independent of population size) WKB-based numerical technique. The method is applied to a central problem in population genetics and evolution, finding the chance of ultimate fixation in a zero-sum, two-types competition.",
  "Bending and pinching of three-phase stripes: From secondary instabilities to morphological deformations in organic photovoltaics.\nOptimizing the properties of the mosaic nanoscale morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPV) is not only challenging technologically but also intriguing from the mechanistic point of view. Among the recent breakthroughs is the identification and utilization of a three-phase (donor-mixed-acceptor) BHJ, where the (intermediate) mixed phase can inhibit mesoscale morphological changes, such as phase separation. Using a mean-field approach, we reveal and distinguish between generic mechanisms that alter, through transverse instabilities, the evolution of stripes: the bending (zigzag mode) and the pinching (cross-roll mode) of the donor-acceptor domains. The results are summarized in a parameter plane spanned by the mixing energy and illumination, and show that donor-acceptor mixtures with higher mixing energy are more likely to develop pinching under charge-flux boundary conditions. The latter is notorious as it leads to the formation of disconnected domains and hence to loss of charge flux. We believe that these results provide a qualitative road map for BHJ optimization, using mixed-phase composition and, therefore, an essential step toward long-lasting OPV. More broadly, the results are also of relevance to study the coexistence of multiple-phase domains in material science, such as in ion-intercalated rechargeable batteries.",
  "Genotoxicity assessment of biphasic calcium phosphate of modified porosity on human dental pulp cells using Ames and Comet assays.\nBiphasic Calcium Phosphate (BCP) with a ratio of 20/80 Hydroxyapatite (HA)/Beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) promotes the differentiation of human dental pulp cells (HDPCs). In the current study, the genotoxicity of locally produced BCP of modified porosity (65%) with a mean pore size of 300micrometer (μm) was assessed using Comet and Ames assays. HDPCs were treated with BCP extract at three different inhibitory concentrations which were obtained based on cytotoxicity test conducted with concurrent negative and positive controls. The tail moment of HDPCs treated with BCP extract at all three concentrations showed no significant difference compared to negative control (p>0.05), indicating that BCP did not induce DNA damage to HDPCs. The BCP was evaluated using five tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1537 and TA1538. Each strain was incubated with BCP extract with five different concentrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation system (S9) mix. Concurrently, negative and positive controls were included. The average number of revertant colonies per plate treated with the BCP extract was less than double as compared to the number of revertant colonies in negative control plate and no dose-related increase was observed. Results from both assays suggested that the BCP of modified porosity did not exhibit any genotoxic effect under the present test conditions.",
  "Infima statistics of entropy production in an underdamped Brownian motor.\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy never decreases for isolated macroscopical systems, which defines the arrow of time. For small systems, although the entropy increases on average, due to strong fluctuation, it may encounter a temporary decrease. The probability of negative entropy production follows the fluctuation theorem. Recently, it has been demonstrated theoretically the infima law that there exists a lower bound for the average values of the minima of the negative entropy production, which is -k_{B}. In this paper, we have constructed a horizontal Brownian motor immersed in a granular gas, whose dynamics is governed by the underdamped stochastic process. By recording the angular motion of the motor and measuring the key parameters of the system, we experimentally demonstrate that, despite the nonideal elements in the experiments and that the complex underlying dynamics, the average value of the minima of the negative entropy production is still bounded by -k_{B}, which may invoke further theoretical investigations of the applicability of the infima law in nonideal realistic small systems.",
  "Random matrix spectral form factor in kicked interacting fermionic chains.\nWe study quantum chaos and spectral correlations in periodically driven (Floquet) fermionic chains with long-range two-particle interactions, in the presence and absence of particle-number conservation [U(1)] symmetry. We analytically show that the spectral form factor precisely follows the prediction of random matrix theory in the regime of long chains, and for timescales that exceed the so-called Thouless time which scales with the size L as O(L^{2}), or O(L^{0}), in the presence, or absence, of U(1) symmetry, respectively. Using a random phase assumption which essentially requires a long-range nature of the interaction, we demonstrate that the Thouless time scaling is equivalent to the behavior of the spectral gap of a classical Markov chain, which is in the continuous-time (Trotter) limit generated, respectively, by a gapless XXX, or gapped XXZ, spin-1/2 chain Hamiltonian.",
  "Origin of subdiffusions in proteins: Insight from peptide systems.\nSubdiffusive kinetics are popular in proteins and peptides as observed in experiments and simulations. For protein systems with diverse interactions, are there multiple mechanisms to produce the common subdiffusion behavior? To approach this problem, long trajectories of two model peptides are simulated to study the mechanism of subdiffusion and the relations with their interactions. The free-energy profiles and the subdiffusive kinetics are observed for these two peptides. A hierarchical plateau analysis is employed to extract the features of the landscape from the mean square of displacement. The mechanism of subdiffusions can be postulated by comparing the exponents by simulations with those based on various models. The results indicate that the mechanisms of these two peptides are different and are related to the characteristics of their energy landscapes. The subdiffusion of the flexible peptide is mainly caused by depth distribution of traps on the energy landscape, while the subdiffusion of the helical peptide is attributed to the fractal topology of local minima on the landscape. The emergence of these different mechanisms reflects different kinetic scenarios in peptide systems though the peptides behave in a similar way of diffusion. To confirm these ideas, the transition networks between various conformations of these peptides are generated. Based on the network description, the controlled kinetics based only on the topology of the networks are calculated and compared with the results based on simulations. For the flexible peptide, the feature of controlled diffusion is distinct from that of simulation, and for the helical peptide, two kinds of kinetics have a similar exponent of subdiffusion. These results further exemplify the importance of the landscape topology in the kinetics of structural proteins and the effect of depth distribution of traps for the subdiffusion of disordered peptides.",
  "Strong shock as a stringent test for Onsager-Burnett equations.\nA new set of thermodynamically consistent Onsager-Burnett equations [Singh, Jadhav, and Agrawal, Phys. Rev. E 96, 013106 (2017)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.96.013106] has recently been derived. In this work, we subject these equations to a severe test case of strong shock (Mach number = 134) for a dilute gas system composed of hard-sphere molecules. The numerical results of OBurnett equations for conserved and nonconserved variables are compared against the molecular dynamics and direct simulation Monte Carlo results available in the literature. With no tweaking of the equations in any way, we establish several fundamental aspects of OBurnett equations which other higher-order continuum theories like Burnett and Grad equations lack. In particular, evidence is put forward for smooth shock structures, the existence of heteroclinic trajectory, and positive entropy generation inside the shock at all Mach numbers. With respect to shock profiles of hydrodynamic variables, it is observed that OBurnett equations significantly improve upon the results of Navier-Stokes equations. Further comparison with regularized 13 (R13) equations at lower Mach numbers shows that OBurnett equations capture the more rarefied upstream part better than the R13 equations. These evidences suggest that the OBurnett equations are accurate and form a reliable set of higher-order transport equations. Further, it should now be possible to describe the complex structure of the shock wave correctly, even at a very large Mach number.",
  "Dynamic stiction without static friction: The role of friction vector rotation.\nIn the textbook formulation of dry friction laws, static and dynamic friction (stick and slip) are qualitatively different and sharply separated phenomena. However, accurate measurements of stick-slip motion generally show that static friction is not truly static but characterized by a slow creep that, upon increasing tangential load, smoothly accelerates into bulk sliding. Microscopic, contact-mechanical, and phenomenological models have been previously developed to account for this behavior. In the present work, we show that it may instead be a systemic property of the measurement apparatus. Using a mechanical model that exhibits the characteristics of typical setups of measuring friction forces-which usually have very high transverse stiffness-and assuming a small but nonzero misalignment angle in the contact plane, we observe some fairly counterintuitive behavior: Under increasing longitudinal loading, the system almost immediately starts sliding perpendicularly to the pulling direction. Then the friction force vector begins to rotate in the plane, gradually approaching the pulling direction. When the angle between the two becomes small, bulk sliding sets in quickly. Although the system is sliding the entire time, macroscopic stick-slip behavior is reproduced very well, as is the accelerated creep during the \"stick\" phase. The misalignment angle is identified as a key parameter governing the stick-to-slip transition. Numerical results and theoretical considerations also reveal the presence of high-frequency transverse oscillations during the \"static\" phase, which are also transmitted into the longitudinal direction by nonlinear processes. Stability analysis is carried out and suggests dynamic probing methods for the approaching moment of bulk slip and the possibility of suppressing stick-slip instabilities by changing the misalignment angle and other system parameters.",
  "Evaluating snail-trail frameworks for leader-follower behavior with agent-based modeling.\nBranched networks constitute a ubiquitous structure in biology, arising in plants, lungs, and the circulatory system; however, the mechanisms behind their creation are not well understood. A commonly used model for network morphogenesis proposes that sprouts develop through interactions between leader (tip) cells and follower (stalk) cells. In this description, tip cells emerge from existing structures, travel up chemoattractant gradients, and form new networks by guiding the movement of stalk cells. Such dynamics have been mathematically represented by continuum \"snail-trail\" models in which the tip cell flux contributes to the stalk cell proliferation rate. Although snail-trail models constitute a classical depiction of leader-follower behavior, their accuracy has yet to be evaluated in a rigorous quantitative setting. Here, we extend the snail-trail modeling framework to two spatial dimensions by introducing a novel multiplicative factor to the stalk cell rate equation, which corrects for neglected network creation in directions other than that of the migrating front. Our derivation of this factor demonstrates that snail-trail models are valid descriptions of cell dynamics when chemotaxis dominates cell movement. We confirm that our snail-trail model accurately predicts the dynamics of tip and stalk cells in an existing agent-based model (ABM) for network formation [Pillay et al., Phys. Rev. E 95, 012410 (2017)10.1103/PhysRevE.95.012410]. We also derive conditions for which it is appropriate to use a reduced, one-dimensional snail-trail model to analyze ABM results. Our analysis identifies key metrics for cell migration that may be used to anticipate when simple snail-trail models will accurately describe experimentally observed cell dynamics in network formation.",
  "Discovery of oscillations in rotational speed of body-tethered Caulobacter crescentus.\nSwarmer cells of Caulobacter crescentus have been found to tether to glass at a point on the cell body. The rolling of the freely rotating flagellum near the glass surface causes the cell body to rotate. We describe the discovery of damped oscillations in the rotational speed of these cell bodies. We show that the damped oscillations are robust over multiple cells and that they depend more on the cell's accumulated rotation angle than on time. We also find that their phase is determined by the moment the flagellar motor changes the direction of its rotation. The oscillations occur only for one direction of cell rotation, when the flagellum is in pulling mode. We discuss possible explanations for these oscillations, including fluctuations in flagellar motor torque and periodic changes in flagellar orientation, and illustrate both of these cases using simplified computer models. Finally, we present the hypothesis that the oscillations are the result of fluctuations in the proton motive force, initiated by a sudden change in proton current that occurs when the motor switches rotation direction.",
  "Integrability of one-dimensional Lindbladians from operator-space fragmentation.\nWe introduce families of one-dimensional Lindblad equations describing open many-particle quantum systems that are exactly solvable in the following sense: (i) The space of operators splits into exponentially many (in system size) subspaces that are left invariant under the dissipative evolution; (ii) the time evolution of the density matrix on each invariant subspace is described by an integrable Hamiltonian. The prototypical example is the quantum version of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) which we analyze in some detail. We show that in each invariant subspace the dynamics is described in terms of an integrable spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain with either open or twisted boundary conditions. We further demonstrate that Lindbladians featuring integrable operator-space fragmentation can be found in spin chains with arbitrary local physical dimensions.",
  "Continuous and discontinuous transitions in the depinning of two-dimensional dusty plasmas on a one-dimensional periodic substrate.\nLangevin dynamical simulations are performed to study the depinning dynamics of two-dimensional dusty plasmas on a one-dimensional periodic substrate. From the diagnostics of the sixfold coordinated particles P_{6} and the collective drift velocity V_{x}, three different states appear, which are the pinning, disordered plastic flow, and moving ordered states. It is found that the depth of the substrate is able to modulate the properties of the depinning phase transition, based on the results of P_{6} and V_{x}, as well as the observation of hysteresis of V_{x} while increasing and decreasing the driving force monotonically. When the depth of the substrate is shallow, there are two continuous phase transitions. When the potential well depth slightly increases, the phase transition from the pinned to the disordered plastic flow states is continuous; however, the phase transition from the disordered plastic flow to the moving ordered states is discontinuous. When the substrate is even deeper, the phase transition from the pinned to the disordered plastic flow states changes to discontinuous. When the depth of the substrate further increases, as the driving force increases, the pinned state changes to the moving ordered state directly, so that the disordered plastic flow state disappears completely.",
  "Kink-antikink collisions in a weakly interacting ϕ^{4} model.\nKink-antikink scattering in nonintegrable field theories like ϕ^{4} theory is still rather poorly understood beyond brute-force numerical calculations, even after several decades of investigation. Recently, however, some progress has been made based on the introduction of certain self-dual background fields in these field theories which imply both the existence of static kink-antikink solutions of the Bogomol'nyi type and the possibility of an adiabatic scattering (moduli space approximation). Here we continue and generalize these investigations by introducing a one-parameter family of models interpolating between the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) model with the self-dual background field and the original ϕ^{4} theory. More concretely, we study kink-antikink scattering in a parameter range between the limit of no static force (BPS limit) and the regime where the static interaction between kink and antikink is small (non-BPS regime). This allows us to study the impact of the strength of the intersoliton static force on the soliton dynamics. In particular, we analyze how the transition of a bound mode through the mass threshold affects the soliton dynamics in a generic process, i.e., when a static intersoliton force shows up. We show that the thin, precisely localized spectral wall which forms in the limit of no static force broadens in a well-defined manner when a static force is included, giving rise to what we call a thick spectral wall. This phenomenon results from the appearance of a stationary saddle point solution where the acceleration of the solitons owing to the attractive force is compensated by the dynamics of the sufficiently excited mode. Thus, this barrier shows up before the mode crosses the mass threshold.",
  "De novo RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis of Papiliotrema laurentii strain RY1 under nitrogen starvation.\nNitrogen is a key nutrient for all cell forms. Most organisms respond to nitrogen scarcity by slowing down their growth rate. On the contrary, our previous studies have shown that Papiliotrema laurentii strain RY1 has a robust growth under nitrogen starvation. To understand the global regulation that leads to such an extraordinary response, we undertook a de novo approach for transcriptome analysis of the yeast. Close to 33 million sequence reads of high quality for nitrogen limited and enriched condition were generated using Illumina NextSeq500. Trinity analysis and clustered transcripts annotation of the reads produced 17,611 unigenes, out of which 14,157 could be annotated. Gene Ontology term analysis generated 44.92% cellular component terms, 39.81% molecular function terms and 15.24% biological process terms. The most over represented pathways in general were translation, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, general metabolism, folding, sorting, degradation followed by transport and catabolism, nucleotide metabolism, replication and repair, transcription and lipid metabolism. A total of 4256 Single Sequence Repeats were identified. Differential gene expression analysis detected 996 P-significant transcripts to reveal transmembrane transport, lipid homeostasis, fatty acid catabolism and translation as the enriched terms which could be essential for Papiliotrema laurentii strain RY1 to adapt during nitrogen deprivation. Transcriptome data was validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of twelve transcripts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Papiliotrema laurentii strain RY1 transcriptome which would play a pivotal role in understanding the biochemistry of the yeast under acute nitrogen stress and this study would be encouraging to initiate extensive investigations into this Papiliotrema system.",
  "Optimization of cranial computed tomography in patients with AIDS and clinical suspicion of a neural opportunistic pathology.\nCranial computed tomography (CT) remains valuable for the identification of opportunistic pathologies in AIDS patients in low-income countries. Delayed iodinated contrast medium CT images have the potential to better demonstrate inflammatory-infectious or neoplastic opportunistic pathologies. The main objective of this study was to optimize the protocol for cranial CT in patients with AIDS and clinical signs of opportunistic pathologies at the authors' institution. It was hypothesized that 20-min delayed contrast-enhanced CT images would be sufficient to optimize the detection of brain pathologies and that no additional delayed images would be necessary. Twenty-six adult patients with AIDS and brain pathologies were enrolled and had their cranial CT images analyzed by three evaluators. The numbers of lesions identified at two predetermined delayed time-points were compared. There was no variation in the number of lesions depicted by each evaluator, between the 20-min delayed contrast-enhanced CT image and the image obtained at the other predetermined delayed time-point.",
  "Ring structure of selected two-dimensional procrystalline lattices.\nRecent work has introduced the term \"procrystalline\" to define systems which lack translational symmetry but have an underlying high-symmetry lattice. The properties of five such two-dimensional (2D) lattices are considered in terms of the topologies of rings which may be formed from three-coordinate sites only. Parent lattices with full coordination numbers of four, five, and six are considered, with configurations generated using a Monte Carlo algorithm. The different lattices are shown to generate configurations with varied ring distributions. The different constraints imposed by the underlying lattices are discussed. Ring size distributions are obtained analytically for two of the simpler lattices considered (the square and trihexagonal nets). In all cases, the ring size distributions are compared to those obtained via a maximum entropy method. The configurations are analyzed with respect to the near-universal Lemaître curve (which connects the fraction of six-membered rings with the width of the ring size distribution) and three lattices are highlighted as rare examples of systems which generate configurations which do not map onto this curve. The assortativities are considered, which contain information on the degree of ordering of different sized rings within a given distribution. All of the systems studied show systematically greater assortativities when compared to those generated using a standard bond-switching method. Comparison is also made to two series of crystalline motifs which shown distinctive behavior in terms of both the ring size distributions and the assortativities. Procrystalline lattices are therefore shown to have fundamentally different behavior to traditional disordered and crystalline systems, indicative of the partial ordering of the underlying lattices.",
  "Solitary waves dynamic for Davydov α-helical protein model: Effects of localized and periodic inhomogeneities.\nWe describe the dynamic of excitons through single inhomogeneous α-helical proteins with off-diagonal and diagonal couplings. Inhomogeneities considered are either localized or periodic. Intensive numerical simulations carried show stable structures and allow us to single out important features of excitons dynamic. In the absence of inhomogeneities, the interplay between off-diagonal and diagonal couplings leads to two distinct types of solitary waves. Bright solitary waves correspond to an off-diagonal coupling constant lower than a critical diagonal coupling constant, while dark solitary waves are obtained in the opposite case. Inclusion of inhomogeneities profoundly affects the profiles, amplitudes, and energies transported by the waves. For relatively small strength of inhomogeneities, only the profiles of the waves significantly change, the other properties remaining almost unchanged. Large strength inhomogeneities sensitively twist the profiles and increase amplitudes and energies of the waves. Our study suggests that small strength inhomogeneities allow a coherent transport of energy and the biological functions remain unchanged, but large strengths of inhomogeneities affect the biological functioning of the α-helical protein chains. Hence, large strengths of inhomogeneities may amplify the energy of the molecule and could be used to treat some diseases.",
  "Variational approximation for two-dimensional quantum droplets.\nThe dynamics of a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in a presence of quantum fluctuations is studied. The properties of localized density distributions, quantum droplets (QDs), are analyzed by means of the variational approach. It is demonstrated that the super-Gaussian function gives a good approximation for profiles of fundamental QDs and droplets with nonzero vorticity. The dynamical equations for parameters of QDs are obtained. Fixed points of these equations determine the parameters of stationary QDs. The period of small oscillations of QDs near the stationary state is estimated. It is obtained that periodic modulations of the strength of quantum fluctuations can actuate different processes, including resonance oscillations of the QD parameters, an emission of waves and a splitting of QDs into smaller droplets.",
  "Visualizing free-energy landscapes for four hard disks.\nWe present a simple model system with four hard disks moving in a circular region for which free-energy landscapes can be directly calculated and visualized in two and three dimensions. We construct several energy landscapes for our system, and we explore the strengths and limitations of each in terms of understanding system dynamics, in particular the relationship between state transitions and free-energy barriers. We also demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between system dynamics in real space and those in landscape coordinates, and we show that care must be taken to appropriately combine dynamics with barrier properties to understand the transition rates. This simple model provides an intuitive way to understand free-energy landscapes, and it illustrates the benefits that free-energy landscapes can have over potential energy landscapes.",
  "Cytostatic hydroxycoumarin OT52 induces ER/Golgi stress and STAT3 inhibition triggering non-canonical cell death and synergy with BH3 mimetics in lung cancer.\nCoumarins are natural compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer potential known to modulate inflammatory pathways. Here, non-toxic biscoumarin OT52 strongly inhibited proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells with KRAS mutations, inhibited stem-like characteristics by reducing aldehyde dehydrogenase expression and abrogated spheroid formation capacity. This cytostatic effect was characterized by cell cycle arrest and onset of senescence concomitant with endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi stress, leading to metabolic alterations. Mechanistically, this cellular response was associated with the novel capacity of biscoumarin OT52 to inhibit STAT3 transactivation and expression of its target genes linked to proliferation. These results were validated by computational docking of OT52 to the STAT3 DNA-binding domain. Combination treatments of OT52 with subtoxic concentrations of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1-targeting BH3 protein inhibitors triggered synergistic immunogenic cell death validated in colony formation assays as well as in vivo by zebrafish xenografts.",
  "SEC-induced activation of ANXA7 GTPase suppresses prostate cancer metastasis.\nAnnexin A7 (ANXA7) is a suppressor of tumorigenesis and metastasis in prostate cancer. Activated ANXA7 GTPase promotes prostate cancer cell apoptosis. However, the role and underlying mechanism of ANXA7 GTPase in prostate cancer metastasis have not been established. RKIP is a metastatic suppressor and downregulated in prostate cancer metastases. The binding of RKIP and its target proteins could inhibit the activation of its interactive partners. However, the effect of RKIP on ANXA7 GTPase activation is not clear. Here, we report that activation of ANXA7 GTPase by a small molecule SEC ((S)-ethyl 1-(3-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl)-3- (4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate) effectively inhibited prostate cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, activated ANXA7 promoted AMPK phosphorylation, leading to decreased mTORC1 activity, suppressed STAT3 nuclear translocation, and downregulation of pro-metastatic genes, including CCL2, APLN, and IL6ST. Conversely, RKIP interacted with ANXA7 and impaired activation of ANXA7 GTPase by SEC and its downstream signaling pathway. Notably, SEC treatment suppressed metastasis of prostate cancer cells in in vivo orthotopic analysis. Together, our findings provide a novel insight into how metastasis of prostate cancer with low RKIP expression is suppressed by SEC-induced activation of ANXA7 GTPase via the AMPK/mTORC1/STAT3 signaling pathway.",
  "Baseline serum triglyceride predicts early-onset peritonitis and prognosis in incident CAPD patients.\nWe aimed to investigate the hypothesis that serum triglyceride (TG) may be an independent predictor of early-onset peritonitis and prognosis in incident continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients.In this retrospective, observational study, we screened 291 adults admitted to the PD center of the Wuhan No. 1 hospital from August 1, 2013 to November 31, 2017. All biochemical data were collected at the first 1 to 3 months after the initiation of CAPD. Early-onset peritonitis was defined as peritonitis occurring within 6 months after the initiation of PD. All of PD patients were followed up to July 31, 2018. The primary endpoint was the incidence of early-onset peritonitis while the second endpoints included overall mortality and technical failure.A total of 38 patients occurred early-onset PD peritonitis and the Lasso logistic regression selected TG and age in the final model for early-onset peritonitis. We divided patients into two groups based on the median baseline TG levels: TG ≥ 1.4mmo/L group (n = 143) and TG < 1.4mmol/L group (n = 148). There were 34 (11.7%) patients died and 33 (11.3%) patients transferred to hemodialysis during the follow-up, Moreover, a level of TG ≥ 1.4mmol/L at the initiation of CAPD was associated with a significantly increased probability of technical failure (hazard ratio, HR, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.19, P = .043) and overall mortality (HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.16-4.72, P = .018).Serum TG levels measured at the initiation of PD therapy is an independent predictor of early-onset peritonitis and prognosis of CAPD patients.",
  "A novel ultrasonic precise bonding with non-constant amplitude control for thermalplastic polymer MEMS.\nUltrasonic bonding has been emerging paving the way in micro assembly, with the high demand in fusion quality control. Under this background a novel ultrasonic precise bonding method based on non-constant amplitude control is proposed. A two-step bonding process, including frictional heating and viscoelastic heating, divided by the vibration propagation is designed. In step I, initial melting of the contacting surfaces is achieved at the amplitude bigger than the critical value. In step II, the whole interfacial fusion is realized at smaller amplitude to weaken the ultrasonic cavitation effect. The primary parameters in this method, including the amplitudes for the two steps and the conversion point, are studied. Results indicate that whole fusion bonding can be achieved with the flaws restrained. The proportion of cavity reduces to less than 2% when the amplitude for step II is set at a smaller value.",
  "A retrospective analysis of adverse effects of an in vivo fluoroquinolone antibiotic enrofloxacin treatment on oocyte quality in the common marmoset.\nHere we report a retrospective analysis of negative effects of routine enrofloxacin treatment of recurrent diarrhea on the ovary and the developing oocytes of the common marmoset, a small New World primate. The most deleterious effect on oocytes was observed about two months post treatment suggesting that the enrofloxacin effect is on early growing follicles. Manifestations of toxicity included decreased numbers of growing follicles and recovered culturable oocytes, as well as signs of early atresia of granulosa cells. In addition, increased amounts of holed stroma after treatment strongly suggested increased death of the early growing follicles. Of the oocytes judged to be of adequate quality for culture, maturation rates were not affected but fertilization of in vitro matured MII oocytes and subsequent cleavage rates were severely reduced in the enrofloxacin treated animals. Further, the arrested oocytes, which failed to mature or fertilize, showed obvious meiotic spindle abnormalities.",
  "Inferring anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) class of drugs using shortest path and random walk with restart algorithms.\nThe anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system is a widely accepted drug classification scheme. This system comprises five levels and includes several classes in each level. Drugs are classified into classes according to their therapeutic effects and characteristics. The first level includes 14 main classes. In this study, we proposed two network-based models to infer novel potential chemicals deemed to belong in the first level of ATC classification. To build these models, two large chemical networks were constructed using the chemical-chemical interaction information retrieved from the Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH). Two classic network algorithms, shortest path (SP) and random walk with restart (RWR) algorithms, were executed on the corresponding network to mine novel chemicals for each ATC class using the validated drugs in a class as seed nodes. Then, the obtained chemicals yielded by these two algorithms were further evaluated by a permutation test and an association test. The former can exclude chemicals produced by the structure of the network, i.e., false positive discoveries. By contrast, the latter identifies the most important chemicals that have strong associations with the ATC class. Comparisons indicated that the two models can provide quite dissimilar results, suggesting that the results yielded by one model can be essential supplements for those obtained by the other model. In addition, several representative inferred chemicals were analyzed to confirm the reliability of the results generated by the two models. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Accelerating Precision Medicine through Genetic and Genomic Big Data Analysis edited by Yudong Cai & Tao Huang.",
  "α-Solanine impairs oocyte maturation and quality by inducing autophagy and apoptosis and changing histone modifications in a pig model.\nIn this study, we used a pig model to investigate the effects of α-solanine (a natural toxin found mainly in potato sprouts) on oocyte maturation, quality and subsequent embryonic development. We found that α-solanine (10 μM) disturbed meiotic resumption and increased abnormal spindle formation and altered the cortical granule (CG) distribution compared with the untreated group. α-Solanine triggered autophagy and apoptosis by increasing the expressions of autophagy-related genes (LC3, ATG7, and LAMP2) and apoptotic related genes (BAX and CASP3). Exposure of porcine oocytes to α-solanine significantly increased the levels of H3K36me3 and H3K27me3. Moreover, α-solanine significantly reduced the cleavage and blastocyst formation rates, decreased the total and inner cell mass cells numbers, and increased apoptosis in these porcine embryos. Taken together, our data indicate that α-solanine toxically impairs oocyte maturation and quality by triggering autophagy/apoptosis and facilitating epigenetic modifications. Furthermore, α-solanine suppressed subsequent embryonic development and reduced embryo quality.",
  "Amlexanox provides a potential therapy for nonsense mutations in the lysosomal storage disorder Aspartylglucosaminuria.\nAspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene for aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA). This enzyme participates in glycoprotein degradation in lysosomes. AGU results in progressive mental retardation, and no curative therapy is currently available. We have here characterized the consequences of AGA gene mutations in a compound heterozygous patient who exhibits a missense mutation producing a Ser72Pro substitution in one allele, and a nonsense mutation Trp168X in the other. Ser72 is not a catalytic residue, but is required for the stabilization of the active site conformation. Thus, Ser72Pro exchange impairs the autocatalytic activation of the AGA precursor, and results in a considerable reduction of the enzyme activity and in altered AGA precursor processing. Betaine, which can partially rescue the AGA activity in AGU patients carrying certain missense mutations, turned out to be ineffective in the case of Ser72Pro substitution. The Trp168X nonsense allele results in complete lack of AGA polypeptide due to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the mRNA. Amlexanox, which inhibits NMD and causes a translational read-through, facilitated the synthesis of a full-length, functional AGA protein from the nonsense allele. This could be demonstrated as presence of the AGA polypeptide and increased enzyme activity upon Amlexanox treatment. Furthermore, in the Ser72Pro/Trp168X expressing cells, Amlexanox induced a synergistic increase in AGA activity and polypeptide processing due to enhanced processing of the Ser72Pro polypeptide. Our data show for the first time that Amlexanox might provide a valid therapy for AGU.",
  "Time of the day dictates the variability of biomarkers of exposure to disinfection byproducts.\nNon-persistent environmental chemicals (NOPEC) are xenobiotics with short half-lives of elimination (<7h). Similar to chronopharmacokinetics, NOPEC metabolism may follow diurnal patterns of cytochrome P450 activity. The role of circadian liver clock in shaping NOPEC metabolism and their concomitant measurements of biomarkers of exposure and effect remains poorly understood in real-life human settings. Metabolic activation (toxication) by CYP2E1 converts trihalomethanes (THM) to harmful metabolites. We investigated the diurnal variation of urinary THM exposures and their metabolism patterns as catalyzed by CYP2E1 redox activity, using the surrogate marker of 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE). We implemented three time-series trials with adult volunteers conducting specific household cleaning activities at predefined times of a day. Circadia variation of 4HNE was assessed with a cosinor model and its mesor levels increased with THM exposure. The time of exposure within the day dictated the magnitude of urinary THM levels and their toxication effect; in all three trials and relative to urinary THM levels before the activity, lower and higher median THM were measured right after the activity in morning and afternoon/night, respectively. This is consistent with higher reported CYP2E1 redox activity in light/active phase. Population health studies should incorporate time-stamped biomarker data to improve the understanding of chronic disease processes.",
  "Transcriptome sequence-based phylogeny of chalcidoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) reveals a history of rapid radiations, convergence, and evolutionary success.\nChalcidoidea are a megadiverse group of mostly parasitoid wasps of major ecological and economical importance that are omnipresent in almost all extant terrestrial habitats. The timing and pattern of chalcidoid diversification is so far poorly understood and has left many important questions on the evolutionary history of Chalcidoidea unanswered. In this study, we infer the early divergence events within Chalcidoidea and address the question of whether or not ancestral chalcidoids were small egg parasitoids. We also trace the evolution of some key traits: jumping ability, development of enlarged hind femora, and associations with figs. Our phylogenetic inference is based on the analysis of 3,239 single-copy genes across 48 chalcidoid wasps and outgroups representatives. We applied an innovative a posteriori evaluation approach to molecular clock-dating based on nine carefully validated fossils, resulting in the first molecular clock-based estimation of deep Chalcidoidea divergence times. Our results suggest a late Jurassic origin of Chalcidoidea, with a first divergence of morphologically and biologically distinct groups in the early to mid Cretaceous, between 129 and 81 million years ago (mya). Diversification of most extant lineages happened rapidly after the Cretaceous in the early Paleogene, between 75 and 53 mya. The inferred Chalcidoidea tree suggests a transition from ancestral minute egg parasitoids to larger-bodied parasitoids of other host stages during the early history of chalcidoid evolution. The ability to jump evolved independently at least three times, namely in Eupelmidae, Encyrtidae, and Tanaostigmatidae. Furthermore, the large-bodied strongly sclerotized species with enlarged hind femora in Chalcididae and Leucospidae are not closely related. Finally, the close association of some chalcidoid wasps with figs, either as pollinators, or as inquilines/gallers or as parasitoids, likely evolved at least twice independently: in the Eocene, giving rise to fig pollinators, and in the Oligocene or Miocene, resulting in non-pollinating fig-wasps, including gallers and parasitoids. The origins of very speciose lineages (e.g., Mymaridae, Eulophidae, Pteromalinae) are evenly spread across the period of chalcidoid evolution from early Cretaceous to the late Eocene. Several shifts in biology and morphology (e.g., in host exploitation, body shape and size, life history), each followed by rapid radiations, have likely enabled the evolutionary success of Chalcidoidea.",
  "Examined lymph node count is not associated with prognosis in elderly patients with pN0 thoracic esophageal cancer.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether the number of lymph nodes dissected predicts prognosis in surgically treated elderly patients with pN0 thoracic esophageal cancer. We searched the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and identified the records of younger (<75 years) and older (≥75 years) patients with pN0 thoracic esophageal cancer between 1998 and 2015. The patient characteristics, tumor data, and postoperative variables were analyzed in this study. The Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox proportional hazard model were used to compare overall and cause-specific survival. Data from 1,792 esophageal cancer patients (older: n = 295; younger: n = 1497) were included. The survival analysis showed that the overall and cause-specific survival in the patients with ≥15 examined lymph nodes (eLNs) was significantly superior to that in the patients with 1 to 14 eLNs (P < .001); however, the difference disappeared in the older patients. After stratification by the tumor location, histology, pT classification, and differentiation between the younger and older cohorts to analyze the association between eLNs and survival, we found that the differences remained significant in most subgroups in the younger cohort. There were no differences in any subgroups of older patients. This study replicated the previously identified finding that long-term survival in patients with extensive lymphadenectomy was significantly superior to that in patients with less extensive lymphadenectomy. However, less extensive lymphadenectomy may be an acceptable treatment modality for elderly patients with pN0 thoracic esophageal cancer.",
  "Structure-activity studies on N-Substituted tranylcypromine derivatives lead to selective inhibitors of lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and potent inducers of leukemic cell differentiation.\nFAD-dependent lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is overexpressed or deregulated in many cancers such as AML and prostate cancer and hence is a promising anticancer target with first inhibitors in clinical trials. Clinical candidates are N-substituted derivatives of the dual LSD1-/monoamine oxidase-inhibitor tranylcypromine (2-PCPA) with a basic amine function in the N-substituent. These derivatives are selective over monoamine oxidases. So far, only very limited information on structure-activity studies about this important class of LSD1 inhibitors is published in peer reviewed journals. Here, we show that N-substituted 2-PCPA derivatives without a basic function or even a polar group are still potent inhibitors of LSD1 in vitro and effectively inhibit colony formation of leukemic cells in culture. Yet, these lipophilic inhibitors also block the structurally related monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B), which may be of interest for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, but this property is undesired for applications in cancer treatment. The introduction of a polar, non-basic function led to optimized structures that retain potent LSD1 inhibitors but exhibit selectivity over MAOs and are highly potent in the suppression of colony formation of cultured leukemic cells. Cellular target engagement is shown via a Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) for LSD1.",
  "Physicochemical, antioxidant, DNA cleaving properties and antimicrobial activity of fisetin-copper chelates.\nFisetin (3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) metal chelates are of interest as this plant polyphenol has revealed broad prospects for its use as natural medicine in the treatment of various diseases. Metal interactions may change or enhance fisetin biological properties so understanding fisetin metal chelation is important for its application not only in medicine but also as a food additive in nutritional supplements. This work was aimed to determine and characterize copper complexes formed in different pH range at applying various metal/ligand ratios. Fisetin and Cu(II)-fisetin complexes were characterized by potentiometric titrations, UV-Vis (Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy), EPR, ESI-MS, FTIR and cyclic voltammetry. Their effects on DNA were investigated by using circular dichroism, spectrofluorimetry and gel electrophoresis methods. The copper complex with the ratio of Cu(II)/fisetin 1/2 exhibited significant DNA cleavage activity, followed by complete degradation of DNA. The influence of copper(II) ions on antioxidant activity of fisetin in vitro has been studied using DPPH, ABTS and mitochondrial assays. The results have pointed out that fisetin or copper complexes can behave both as antioxidants or pro-oxidants. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds has been investigated towards several bacteria and fungi. The copper complex of Cu(II)/fisetin 1/2 ratio showed higher antagonistic activity against bacteria comparing to the ligand and it revealed a promising antifungal activity.",
  "The Ability of Different Imputation Methods to Preserve the Significant Genes and Pathways in Cancer.\nDeciphering important genes and pathways from incomplete gene expression data could facilitate a better understanding of cancer. Different imputation methods can be applied to estimate the missing values. In our study, we evaluated various imputation methods for their performance in preserving significant genes and pathways. In the first step, 5% genes are considered in random for two types of ignorable and non-ignorable missingness mechanisms with various missing rates. Next, 10 well-known imputation methods were applied to the complete datasets. The significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method was applied to detect the significant genes in rectal and lung cancers to showcase the utility of imputation approaches in preserving significant genes. To determine the impact of different imputation methods on the identification of important genes, the chi-squared test was used to compare the proportions of overlaps between significant genes detected from original data and those detected from the imputed datasets. Additionally, the significant genes are tested for their enrichment in important pathways, using the ConsensusPathDB. Our results showed that almost all the significant genes and pathways of the original dataset can be detected in all imputed datasets, indicating that there is no significant difference in the performance of various imputation methods tested. The source code and selected datasets are available on http://profiles.bs.ipm.ir/softwares/imputation_methods/.",
  "Proteomic Analysis Shows Constitutive Secretion of MIF and p53-associated Activity of COX-2<sup>-/-</sup> Lung Fibroblasts.\nThe differential expression of two closelyassociated cyclooxygenase isozymes, COX-1 and COX-2, exhibited functions beyond eicosanoid metabolism. We hypothesized that COX-1 or COX-2 knockout lung fibroblasts may display altered protein profiles which may allow us to further differentiate the functional roles of these isozymes at the molecular level. Proteomic analysis shows constitutive production of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in lung fibroblasts derived from COX-2<sup>-/-</sup> but not wild-type (WT) or COX-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. MIF was spontaneously released in high levels into the extracellular milieu of COX2<sup>-/-</sup> fibroblasts seemingly from the preformed intracellular stores, with no change in the basal gene expression of MIF. The secretion and regulation of MIF in COX-2<sup>-/-</sup> was \"prostaglandin-independent.\" GO analysis showed that concurrent with upregulation of MIF, there is a significant surge in expression of genes related to fibroblast growth, FK506 binding proteins, and isomerase activity in COX-2<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Furthermore, COX-2<sup>-/-</sup> fibroblasts also exhibit a significant increase in transcriptional activity of various regulators, antagonists, and co-modulators of p53, as well as in the expression of oncogenes and related transcripts. Integrative Oncogenomics Cancer Browser (IntroGen) analysis shows downregulation of COX-2 and amplification of MIF and/or p53 activity during development of glioblastomas, ependymoma, and colon adenomas. These data indicate the functional role of the MIF-COX-p53 axis in inflammation and cancer at the genomic and proteomic levels in COX-2-ablated cells. This systematic analysis not only shows the proinflammatory state but also unveils a molecular signature of a pro-oncogenic state of COX-1 in COX-2 ablated cells.",
  "Autocalibration method for non-stationary CT bias correction.\nComputed tomography (CT) is a widely used imaging modality for screening and diagnosis. However, the deleterious effects of radiation exposure inherent in CT imaging require the development of image reconstruction methods which can reduce exposure levels. The development of iterative reconstruction techniques is now enabling the acquisition of low-dose CT images whose quality is comparable to that of CT images acquired with much higher radiation dosages. However, the characterization and calibration of the CT signal due to changes in dosage and reconstruction approaches is crucial to provide clinically relevant data. Although CT scanners are calibrated as part of the imaging workflow, the calibration is limited to select global reference values and does not consider other inherent factors of the acquisition that depend on the subject scanned (e.g. photon starvation, partial volume effect, beam hardening) and result in a non-stationary noise response. In this work, we analyze the effect of reconstruction biases caused by non-stationary noise and propose an autocalibration methodology to compensate it. Our contributions are: 1) the derivation of a functional relationship between observed bias and non-stationary noise, 2) a robust and accurate method to estimate the local variance, 3) an autocalibration methodology that does not necessarily rely on a calibration phantom, attenuates the bias caused by noise and removes the systematic bias observed in devices from different vendors. The validation of the proposed methodology was performed with a physical phantom and clinical CT scans acquired with different configurations (kernels, doses, algorithms including iterative reconstruction). The results confirmed the suitability of the proposed methods for removing the intra-device and inter-device reconstruction biases.",
  "Learning non-linear patch embeddings with neural networks for label fusion.\nIn brain structural segmentation, multi-atlas strategies are increasingly being used over single-atlas strategies because of their ability to fit a wider anatomical variability. Patch-based label fusion (PBLF) is a type of such multi-atlas approaches that labels each target point as a weighted combination of neighboring atlas labels, where atlas points with higher local similarity to the target contribute more strongly to label fusion. PBLF can be potentially improved by increasing the discriminative capabilities of the local image similarity measurements. We propose a framework to compute patch embeddings using neural networks so as to increase discriminative abilities of similarity-based weighted voting in PBLF. As particular cases, our framework includes embeddings with different complexities, namely, a simple scaling, an affine transformation, and non-linear transformations. We compare our method with state-of-the-art alternatives in whole hippocampus and hippocampal subfields segmentation experiments using publicly available datasets. Results show that even the simplest versions of our method outperform standard PBLF, thus evidencing the benefits of discriminative learning. More complex transformation models tended to achieve better results than simpler ones, obtaining a considerable increase in average Dice score compared to standard PBLF.",
  "The determinants of response time in a repeated constant-sum game: A robust Bayesian hierarchical dual-process model.\nThe investigation of response time and behavior has a long tradition in cognitive psychology, particularly for non-strategic decision-making. Recently, experimental economists have also studied response time in strategic interactions, but with an emphasis on either one-shot games or repeated social-dilemmas. I investigate the determinants of response time in a repeated (pure-conflict) game, admitting a unique mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, with fixed partner matching. Response times depend upon the interaction of two decision models embedded in a dual-process framework (Achtziger and Alós-Ferrer, 2014; Alós-Ferrer, 2016). The first decision model is the commonly used win-stay/lose-shift heuristic and the second the pattern-detecting reinforcement learning model in Spiliopoulos (2013b). The former is less complex and can be executed more quickly than the latter. As predicted, conflict between these two models (i.e., each one recommending a different course of action) led to longer response times than cases without conflict. The dual-process framework makes other qualitative response time predictions arising from the interaction between the existence (or not) of conflict and which one of the two decision models the chosen action is consistent with-these were broadly verified by the data. Other determinants of RT were hypothesized on the basis of existing theory and tested empirically. Response times were strongly dependent on the actions chosen by both players in the previous rounds and the resulting outcomes. Specifically, response time was shortest after a win in the previous round where the maximum possible payoff was obtained; response time after losses was significantly longer. Strongly auto-correlated behavior (regardless of its sign) was also associated with longer response times. I conclude that, similar to other tasks, there is a strong coupling in repeated games between behavior and RT, which can be exploited to further our understanding of decision making.",
  "Effect of Creatine Supplementation on Functional Capacity and Muscle Oxygen Saturation in Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Arterial Disease: A Pilot Study of a Randomized, Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.\nThe aim of the study was to verify the effects of creatine (Cr) supplementation on functional capacity (walking capacity; primary outcome) and calf muscle oxygen saturation (StO<sub>2</sub>) (secondary outcome) in symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients. Twenty-nine patients, of both sexes, were randomized (1:1) in a double-blind manner for administration of placebo (PLA, <i>n</i> = 15) or creatine monohydrate (Cr, <i>n</i> = 14). The supplementation protocol consisted of 20 g/day for 1 week divided into four equal doses (loading phase), followed by single daily doses of 5 g in the subsequent 7 weeks (maintenance phase). Functional capacity (total walking distance) was assessed by the 6 min walk test, and calf muscle StO<sub>2</sub> was assessed through near infrared spectroscopy. The measurements were collected before and after loading and after the maintenance phase. The level of significance was <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05. No significant differences were found for function capacity (total walking distance (PLA: pre 389 &#177; 123 m vs. post loading 413 &#177; 131 m vs. post maintenance 382 &#177; 99 m; Cr: pre 373 &#177; 149 m vs. post loading 390 &#177; 115 m vs. post maintenance 369 &#177; 115 m, <i>p</i> = 0.170) and the calf muscle StO<sub>2</sub> parameters (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Short- and long-term Cr supplementation does not influence functional capacity and calf muscle StO<sub>2</sub> parameters in patients with symptomatic PAD.",
  "Salicylaldehyde synthase activity from Venturia inaequalis elicitor-treated cell culture of apple.\nSalicylic acid (SA) is known to trigger a number of plant defense responses upon pathogen attack. It is well known that apple (Malus domestica) plants respond to pathogen invasion by synthesizing SA, but its biosynthesis is not well understood. In this study, we report salicylaldehyde synthase (SAS) activity from Venturia inaequalis elicitor (VIE)-treated cell suspension cultures of apple (Malus domestica 'Florina'). SAS catalyzes non-oxidative C<sub>2</sub>-side chain cleavage of 2-coumaric acid to form salicylaldehyde (SALD) in the presence of a reducing agent such as cysteine. The side chain cleavage mechanism was found to be very similar to that of salicylaldehyde synthase activity from tobacco and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde synthase activity from Vanilla planifolia and Daucus carota. A basal SAS activity was observed in the non-elicited cell cultures, and a 7-fold increase in SAS activity was observed upon elicitation. In parallel to SAS activity, the level of total SA accumulation increased by 5.6-fold after elicitation compared to the untreated control cells. Elicitor treatment further resulted in an 8.7-fold increase in the activity of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) enzyme that preceded the peak of SAS activity and total SA accumulation, suggesting the involvement of the phenylpropanoid pathway in SA metabolism. The preferred substrate for SAS was 2-coumaric acid (Km&#8239;=&#8239;0.35&#8239;mM), with cysteine being the preferred reducing agent. In addition, a 1.8-fold enhancement in the SA content and 0.7-fold enhancement in the SALD content was observed when elicited cell cultures were fed with 2-coumaric acid. These observations suggest the involvement of SAS in SALD biosynthesis.",
  "Study of lipid peroxidation and ascorbic acid protective role in large unilamellar vesicles from a new electrochemical performance.\nIn this contribution an electrochemical study is described for the first time of lipid peroxidation and the role of antioxidant on lipid protection using large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). In order to simulate the cell membrane, LUVs composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) were used. A vesicle-modified electrode was constructed by immobilizing DOPC LUVs onto carbon paste electrodes (CPEs). Lipid peroxidation was studied electrochemically by incubating the vesicle-modified electrodes with hydroxyl (HO) radicals generated via the Fenton reaction. Oxidative damage induced by HO was verified by using square wave voltammetry (SWV) and was indirectly measured by the increase of electrochemical peak current to [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4-</sup> which was used as the electrochemical label. Ascorbic acid (AA) was used as the antioxidant model in order to study its efficacy on free radical scavenging. The decrease of the electrochemical signal confirms the protective key role promoted by AA in the prevention of lipid peroxidation in vesicles. Through microscopy, it was possible to observe morphologic modification on vesicle structures after lipid peroxidation in the presence or absence of AA.",
  "Self-rated health and endogenous selection into primary care.\nThis study assesses the causal effects of primary care utilization on subjective health status in Turkey using individual-level data from the 2012 Health Research Survey. Employing recursive bivariate ordered models that take into account the possibility that selection into healthcare might be correlated with the respondent's self-reported health status, we find that selection into primary care is endogenously determined and that the utilization of primary care significantly improves self-rated health after controlling for sociodemographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors and risk factors, and access to healthcare. We show that the causal association between healthcare utilization and health status is robust to the use of objective measures of health and specific types of care, suggesting that the use of a single-item question on self-rated health and binary measures of preventive care utilization is valid.",
  "Unipept CLI 2.0: adding support for visualizations and functional annotations.\nUnipept is an ecosystem of tools developed for fast metaproteomics data-analysis consisting of a web application, a set of web services (application programming interface, API) and a command-line interface (CLI). After the successful introduction of version 4 of the Unipept web application, we here introduce version 2.0 of the API and CLI. Next to the existing taxonomic analysis, version 2.0 of the API and CLI provides access to Unipept's powerful functional analysis for metaproteomics samples. The functional analysis pipeline supports retrieval of Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms and InterPro entries for the individual peptides in a metaproteomics sample. This paves the way for other applications and developers to integrate these new information sources into their data processing pipelines, which greatly increases insight into the functions performed by the organisms in a specific environment. Both the API and CLI have also been expanded with the ability to render interactive visualizations from a list of taxon ids. These visualizations are automatically made available on a dedicated website and can easily be shared by users.",
  "A Blue-Purple Pigment-Producing Bacterium Isolated from the Vezelka River in the City of Belgorod.\nViolacein is a biotechnologically significant secondary metabolite due to its antibacterial, antifungal, and other properties. Isolation, research, and identification of violacein producing strains are of interest for the development of biotechnological processes, in order to enhance the biosynthesis of this compound. The purpose of the present work was to study the properties of a newly isolated bacterium capable of synthesizing blue-purple pigment. An aboriginal bacterium was isolated from the coastal zone of the Vezelka River in the city of Belgorod. Based on chemical and spectrophotometric studies of the crude ethanol extract, the pigment was identified as violacein, and the isolate was assigned to the group of violacein-forming bacteria, which includes bacteria of the genera <i>Chromobacterium</i>, <i>Iodobacter</i>, <i>Janthinobacterium</i>, <i>Duganella</i>, <i>Collimonas</i>, and <i>Massilia</i>. Based on cultural, morphological, tinctorial, physiological, and biochemical properties, as well as analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, the new isolated strain was assigned to the genus <i>Janthinobacterium</i>. The isolated strain is capable of suppressing the growth of a number of fungal and bacterial phytopathogens. For representatives of the genus <i>Janthinobacterium</i>, their inhibitory influence on cyanobacteria was shown for the first time.",
  "A Theoretical and Experimental Study on the Potential Luminescent and Biological Activities of Diaminodicyanoquinodimethane Derivatives.\nRecently, several studies have demonstrated that diaminodicyanoquinone derivatives (DADQs) could present interesting fluorescence properties. Furthermore, some DADQs under the solid state are capable of showing quantum yields that can reach values of 90%. Besides, the diaminodiacyanoquinone core represents a versatile building block propense either to modification or integration into different systems to obtain and provide them unique photophysical features. Herein, we carried out a theoretical study on the fluorescence properties of three different diaminodicyanoquinodimethane systems. Therefore, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) was used to obtain the values associated with the dipole moments, oscillator strengths, and the conformational energies between the ground and the first excited states of each molecule. The results suggest that only two of the three studied systems possess significant luminescent properties. In a further stage, the theoretical insights were confirmed by means of experimental measurements, which not only retrieved the photoluminescence of the DADQs, but also suggest a preliminary and promising antibacterial activity of these systems.",
  "Distinct pathological profiles of inmates showcasing cluster B personality traits, mental disorders and substance use regarding violent behaviors.\nHigh rates of violence are found amid offenders with severe mental illnesses (SMI), substance use disorders (SUDs) and Cluster B personality disorders. Elevated rates of comorbidity lead to inconsistencies when it comes to this relationship. Furthermore, overlapping Cluster B personality traits have been associated with violence. Using multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis, this study was designed to differentiate profiles of 728 male inmates from penitentiary and psychiatric settings marked by personality traits, SMI and SUDs following different violent patterns. Six significantly differing clusters emerged. Cluster 1, \"Sensation seekers\", presented recklessness with SUDs and low prevalence's of SMI and auto-aggression. Two clusters committed more sexual offenses. While Cluster 2, \"Opportunistic-sexual offenders\", had more antisocial lifestyles and SUDs, Cluster 6, \"Emotional-sexual offenders\", displayed more emotional disturbances with SMI and violence. Clusters 3 and 4, representing \"Life-course-persistent offenders\", shared early signs of persistent antisocial conduct and severe violence. Cluster 3, \"Early-onset violent delinquents\", emerged as more severely antisocial with SUDs. Cluster 4, \"Early-onset unstable-mentally ill delinquents\", were more emotionally driven, with SMI and auto-aggression. Cluster 5, \"Late-start offenders\", was less severely violent, and emotionally driven with antisocial behavior beginning later. This study suggests the presence of specific psychopathological organizations in violent inmates.",
  "Loss of Motility as a Non-Lethal Mechanism for Intercolony Inhibition (\"Sibling Rivalry\") in <i>Marinobacter</i>.\nBacteria from the genus <i>Marinobacter</i> are ubiquitous throughout the worlds' oceans as \"opportunitrophs\" capable of surviving a wide range of conditions, including colonization of surfaces of marine snow and algae. To prevent too many bacteria from occupying this ecological niche simultaneously, some sort of population dependent control must be operative. Here, we show that while <i>Marinobacter</i> do not produce or utilize an acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-based quorum sensing system, \"sibling\" colonies of many species of <i>Marinobacter</i> exhibit a form of non-lethal chemical communication that prevents colonies from overrunning each other's niche space. Evidence suggests that this inhibition is the result of a loss in motility for cells at the colony interfaces. Although not the signal itself, we have identified a protein, glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase, that is enriched in the inhibition zone between the spreading colonies that may be part of the overall response.",
  "Eucalypt plants are physiologically and metabolically affected by infection with Ceratocystis fimbriata.\nCeratocystis wilt, caused by Ceratocystis fimbriata, is currently one of the most important disease in eucalypt plantations. Plants infected by C. fimbriata have lower volumetric growth, lower pulp yields and reduced timber values. The physiological bases of infection induced by this pathogen in eucalypt plant are not known. Therefore, this study aims to assess the physiological and metabolic changes in eucalypt clones that are resistant and susceptible to C. fimbriata. Once, we evaluated in detail their leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, water potential, metabolite profiling and growth-related parameters. When inoculated, the susceptible clone displayed reduced water potential, CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, photochemical quenching coefficient, electron transport rate, and root biomass. Inoculated resistant and susceptible clones both presented higher respiration rates than healthy plants. Many compounds of primary and secondary metabolism were significantly altered after fungal infection in both clones. These results suggest that, C. fimbriata interferes in the primary and secondary metabolism of plants that may be linked to the induction of defense mechanisms and that, due to water restrictions caused by the fungus in susceptible plants, there is a partial closure of the stomata to prevent water loss and a consequent reduction in photosynthesis and the transpiration rate, which in turn, leads to a decrease in the plant's growth-related. These results combined, allowed for a better understanding of the physiological and metabolic changes following the infectious process of C. fimbriata, which limit eucalypt plant growth.",
  "Physiological and antioxidant responses of the sabkha biotope halophyte Limonium delicatulum to seasonal changes in environmental conditions.\nIn saline biotopes, different mechanisms may contribute to the tolerance of halophytes to high soil salinity and temperature, drought and other abiotic stresses, but their relative responses and their ecological plasticity for a given species remain unknown. In this study, we examined the responses of the salt marsh halophyte Limonium delicatulum to changing environmental conditions of its natural habitats (Sabkha \"El Kalbia\", Tunisia). The specific aim of the work was to check whether statistically significant correlations could be established between particular stress response mechanisms (ion uptake, activation of antioxidant systems) and soil parameters and climatic data associated with environmental stress. The results showed that the salinity of the soil increased during the months of June, July and August (dry period), concomitantly with a strong accumulation of salt ions in the aerial parts of the plant. Moreover, the highest antioxidant capacity of this halophyte (enzymes and antioxidant molecules) was reached during the same period of the year. The remaining periods (corresponding to the rainy season) did not show a significant difference in enzymes activities and level of antioxidants, with a minimum observed in the months of January and February. These results show a remarkable effect of salinity in the natural habitat on the activity of enzymes and antioxidant molecules. Other edaphic and climatic factors could also be involved to increase antioxidant capacity, such as nutrient deficiency, temperature and precipitation.",
  "Preparation and Physico-Chemical Performance Optimization of Sintering-Free Lightweight Aggregates with High Proportions of Red Mud.\nSintering-free lightweight aggregates were prepared with high proportions of red mud and a binder material derived from whole solid wastes through rolling granulation at room temperature. The preparation process was optimized by changing the material matching and size parameters of the SFLAs. The physico-chemical performance, including the density, mechanical strength, water absorption, hydration products, heavy metal leaching, and microstructure were evaluated by jointly employing X-ray Fluorescence, X-ray Diffraction, and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry, Shadow Electron Microscope, etc. The results indicated that the red mud and waste-based binders were highly compatible in the granulation process, with up to 80% red mud being successfully added. The sintering-free lightweight aggregates products at the binder content of 30% and the size coverage of 10-16 mm exhibited a bulk density of 900-1000 kg&#183;m<sup>-3</sup>, a 28 d cylinder compressive strength of 9.2-11.3 MPa, and water absorption of less than 10%. Owing to the formation of important hydration products, ettringite, the heavy metal leaching of the sintering-free lightweight aggregates was also proven to be environmentally acceptable. This work provides a promising pathway to prepare low-cost, high-strength, and green lightweight aggregates through the large-scale utilization of solid waste red mud.",
  "Cyanotoxins as the \"common suspects\" for the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) deaths in a Mediterranean reconstructed reservoir.\nToxic cyanobacterial blooms have been implicated for their negative consequences on many terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Water birds belong to the most common members of the freshwater food chains and are most likely to be affected by the consumption of toxic cyanobacteria as food. However, the contribution of cyanotoxins in bird mortalities is under-studied. The aim of the study was to investigate the likely role of cyanotoxins in a mass mortality event of the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) in the Karla Reservoir, in Greece. Water, scum, tissues and stomach content of dead birds were examined for the presence of microcystins, cylindrospermopsins and saxitoxins by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High abundances of potential toxic cyanobacterial species and significant concentrations of cyanotoxins were recorded in the reservoir water. All examined tissues and stomach content of the Dalmatian pelicans contained significant concentrations of microcystins and saxitoxins. Cylindrospermopsin concentrations were detected in all tissues except from the brain. Our results suggest that cyanotoxins are a plausible cause for this bird mass mortality episode in the Karla Reservoir.",
  "When Attempting Chain Extension, Even Without Solvent, It Is Not Possible to Avoid Chojnowski Metathesis Giving D<sub>3</sub>.\nA simple, mild and efficient method to prepare HSi- or HOSi-telechelic, high-molecular-weight polydimethylsiloxane polymers (to 41,600 g&#183;mol<sup>-1</sup>) using the one-shot hydrolysis of M<sup>H</sup>M<sup>H</sup> is reported; titration of the water allowed for higher molecular weights (to 153,900 g&#183;mol<sup>-1</sup>). The \"living\" character of the chain extension processes was demonstrated by adding a small portion of M<sup>H</sup>M<sup>H</sup> and B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (BCF) to a first formed polymer, which led to a ~2-fold, second growth in molecular weight. The heterogeneous reaction reached completion in less than 30 min, much less in some cases, regardless of whether it was performed neat or 50 wt% in dry toluene; homogeneous reactions in toluene were much slower. The process does not involve traditional redistribution, as judged by the low quantities (&lt;3%) of D<sub>4</sub> produced. However, it is not possible to avoid Chojnowski metathesis from M<sup>H</sup>DDM<sup>H</sup> giving D<sub>3</sub>, which occurs competitively with chain extension.",
  "Integration of behavioral tests and biochemical biomarkers of terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber (Isopoda, Crustacea) is a promising methodology for testing environmental safety of chars.\nWe investigated how different carbonized materials, or chars (olive mill pomace biochar (BC) and urban greens pruning residues hydrochar (HC)) affect an important member of soil fauna, the terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber. The selection behavior of isopods towards chars after a 48 h exposure was studied in (i) soil-char amended tests with single and multiple choices, and (ii) tests with chars offered as pure material. Finally, we exposed the isopods to char-amended soils for a period of 14 days to follow the effect on food consumption, body mass and activities of enzymes that are commonly altered upon stressor exposure (acetylcholinesterase, AChE, and glutathione S-transferase, GST). We showed that isopods are able to select between char amended and un-amended soil and different forms of char amendments: a clear preference for BC, and avoidance of HC were evidenced. The preferences remained the same when the chars were sterilized leading to the conclusion that initial microorganism composition was not the reason for selection, but selection was governed by other chars' physico-chemical properties. It remains to be elucidated which of these properties were the dominant reason for the selection. We also showed that isopods intentionally use BC as food at a similar rate to alder leaves. Medium-term exposure to HC resulted in adverse effects on isopods because it led to reduced feeding and growth, in addition to increasing GST activity, although no alterations in AChE activity were found. We suggest that behavioral tests with P. scaber could be used as a fast, reliable and economically feasible screening method for determining the safety of chars for the soil environment. Results represent significant contribution in the field of char toxicity testing, highlighting the importance of tests with isopods as important members of soil meso fauna, with the aim of influencing environmental policies and quality standards.",
  "Stream transport of iron and phosphorus by authigenic nanoparticles in the Southern Piedmont of the U.S.\nAuthigenic nanoparticles containing iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) have been identified at the anoxic/oxic interface of various aquatic ecosystems, forming upon the oxidation of reduced Fe. Little is known about the prevalence of these authigenic nanoparticles in streams, their impact on biogeochemical fluxes, or the bioavailability of P associated with them. In this paper we used transmission electron microscopy to document the presence of authigenic (amorphous) nanoparticles, rich in Fe and P, in baseflow of streams in the Southern Piedmont region of the U.S. We used a simple centrifugation and ultrafiltration technique to separate authigenic nanoparticles from truly dissolved (<1 kDa) and crystalline mineral/coarse organic fractions in baseflow, employing three different quality control methods to verify a successful separation: X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and stoichiometry of Fe and aluminum. This allowed us to quantify the amount of Fe and P in three different fractions of baseflow: truly dissolved, authigenic nanoparticles, and crystalline mineral/coarse organic particles. For the rural and urban stream in our study, on average, authigenic nanoparticles in baseflow transport 66% of Fe, with baseflow concentrations ranging from 80 μg/L to 650 μg/L. Authigenic nanoparticles also transport an average of 38% of reactive P, depending upon seasonality and time elapsed since the last storm event.",
  "Discovering Genotype Variants in an Infant with VACTERL through Clinical Exome Sequencing: A Support for Personalized Risk Assessment and Disease Prevention.\nCongenital anomalies may have an increased risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) We performed a clinical exome analysis in an infant affected by \"Vertebral, Anorectal, Cardiac, Tracheoesophageal, Genitourinary, and Limb\" (VACTERL) malformation association to identify potential biomarkers that may be helpful for preventing malignancy risk or other chronic processes. Among the variants, six variants that may be linked with VACTERL were identified in the exome analysis. The variants c.501G&gt;C on <i>OLR1</i> and c.-8C&gt;G on <i>PSMA6</i> were previously associated with myocardial infarction. The variants c.1936A&gt;G on <i>AKAP10</i> and c.575A&gt;G on <i>PON1</i> are linked to defects in cardiac conduction and artery disease, respectively. Alterations in metabolism were also suggested by the variants c.860G&gt;A on <i>EPHX2</i> and c.214C&gt;A on <i>GHRL</i>. In addition, three variants associated with colon cancer were discovered. Specifically, the reported variants were c.723G&gt;A on <i>CCND1</i> and c.91T&gt;A on <i>AURKA</i> proto-oncogenes as well as c.827A&gt;C in the tumor suppressor <i>PTPRJ</i>. A further inspection identified 15 rare variants carried by cancer genes. Specifically, these mutations are located on five tumor suppressors (<i>SDHA</i>, <i>RB1CC1</i>, <i>PTCH1</i>, <i>DMBT1</i>, <i>BCR</i>) and eight proto-oncogenes (<i>MERTK</i>, <i>CSF1R</i>, <i>MYB</i>, <i>ROS1</i>, <i>PCM1</i>, <i>FGFR2</i>, <i>MYH11</i>, <i>BRCC3</i>) and have an allele frequency lower than 0.01 in the Genome Aggregation Database (GnomAD). We observed that the cardiac and metabolic phenotypic traits are linked with the genotype of the patient. In addition, the risk of developing neoplasia cannot be excluded a priori. Long-term surgical issues of patients with VATER syndrome could benefit from the clinical exome sequencing of a personalized risk assessment for the appearance of further disease in pubertal timing and adult age.",
  "Characterization and adsorption mechanism of ZrO<sub>2</sub> mesoporous fibers for health-hazardous fluoride removal.\nOne-dimension ZrO<sub>2</sub> mesoporous fibers were successfully synthesized by utilizing the electrospinning device combining with the soft-template method. The morphology and composite of the fibers were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, FT-IR, TGA/DSC and XPS, and the pore structure and surface area were calculated according the BET measured results. The fluoride adsorption performance of the fibers was investigated and the adsorption capacity was upto 297.70&#8239;mg&#8239;g<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the equilibrium concentration could be reached to 1.41&#8239;mg&#8239;L<sup>-1</sup> with the initial of 30&#8239;mg&#8239;L<sup>-1</sup>, and the removal rate could be reached to 95.3%. The adsorption data were well fitted with the Freundlich isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The fibers had a good reusability and long-term utilization for fluoride adsorption. All the results suggested that the as-prepared ZrO<sub>2</sub> mesoporous fibers with high surface area could be an excellent adsorbent for the wastewater defluoridation treatment.",
  "Comprehensive quality evaluation of medical Cannabis sativa L. inflorescence and macerated oils based on HS-SPME coupled to GC-MS and LC-HRMS (q-exactive orbitrap®) approach.\nThere are at least 554 identified compounds in C. sativa L., among them 113 phytocannabinoids and 120 terpenes. Phytocomplex composition differences between the pharmaceutical properties of different medical cannabis chemotype have been attributed to strict interactions, defined as 'entourage effect', between cannabinoids and terpenes as a result of synergic action. The chemical complexity of its bioactive constituents highlight the need for standardised and well-defined analytical approaches able to characterise the plant chemotype, the herbal drug quality as well as to monitor the quality of pharmaceutical cannabis extracts and preparations. Hence, in the first part of this study an analytical procedures involving the combination of headspace-solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled to GC-MS and High Resolution Mass-Spectrometry LC-HRMS (Orbitrap<sup>&#174;</sup>) were set up, validated and applied for the in-depth profiling and fingerprinting of cannabinoids and terpenes in two authorised medical grade varieties of Cannabis sativa L. inflorescences (Bedrocan<sup>&#174;</sup> and Bediol<sup>&#174;</sup>) and in obtained macerated oils. To better understand the trend of all volatile compounds and cannabinoids during oil storage a new procedure for cannabis macerated oil preparation without any thermal step was tested and compared with the existing conventional methods to assess the potentially detrimental effect of heating on overall product quality.",
  "Refolding of autodisplayed anti-NEF scFv through oxidation with glutathione for immunosensors.\nIn this study, a single-domain antibody against negative regulatory factor (anti-NEF scFv) was autodisplayed on the outer membrane of Escherichia coli and used to detect NEF in an immunoassay based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and surface plasmon resonance biosensors. Next, the autodisplayed single-domain antibody was oxidized to form disulfide bonds by using glutathione, and the change in NEF-binding activity of anti-NEF scFv was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based immunoassay, chromogenic immunoassay, and surface plasmon resonance biosensor. For each type of immunoassays the anti-NEF scFv on the isolated outer membrane showed more NEF binding activity after the disulfide bond formation by glutathione. To determine the role of cysteines in anti-NEF scFv, three mutants were prepared, and the NEF binding activity of mutants was compared with that of wild-type anti-NEF scFv in a competitive immunoassay based on FACS. In these mutant studies, the refolding process of autodisplayed anti-NEF scFv by following oxidation via GSH/GSSG revealed that disulfide bonds formed and increased NEF binding activity.",
  "Trajectory Identification for Moving Loads by Multicriterial Optimization.\nMoving load is a fundamental loading pattern for many civil engineering structures and machines. This paper proposes and experimentally verifies an approach for indirect identification of 2D trajectories of moving loads. In line with the \"structure as a sensor\" paradigm, the identification is performed indirectly, based on the measured mechanical response of the structure. However, trivial solutions that directly fit the mechanical response tend to be erratic due to measurement and modeling errors. To achieve physically meaningful results, these solutions need to be numerically regularized with respect to expected geometric characteristics of trajectories. This paper proposes a respective multicriterial optimization framework based on two groups of criteria of a very different nature: mechanical (to fit the measured response of the structure) and geometric (to account for the geometric regularity of typical trajectories). The state-of-the-art multiobjective genetic algorithm NSGA-II is used to find the Pareto front. The proposed approach is verified experimentally using a lab setup consisting of a plate instrumented with strain gauges and a line-follower robot. Three trajectories are tested, and in each case the determined Pareto front is found to properly balance between the mechanical response fit and the geometric regularity of the trajectory.",
  "Temporally extended self-awareness and affective engagement in three-year-olds.\nThe aim of the current study was to analyze the role of affective engagement during social interaction on the emergence of a temporally extended self (TES). A Delayed Self Recognition task was administered in two different social contexts: in presence of the mother (\"Mother condition\") or in presence of an unfamiliar person (\"Experimenter condition\"). The same sample of 71 tree-year-olds was tested twice in these two treatment conditions. Results showed higher self-recognition scores in the \"Mother condition\". These findings are consistent with developing-self theories that emphasize the impact of reciprocal social interaction on the emergence of self-awareness, and support a conception of the Self as a dialogic entity. We interpreted this link as a evidence that, when completing the procedure with their mother, children are aware of her attention, which corresponds to a familiar mode of self-perception, as well as to a peculiar affective consciousness of Self.",
  "Relative abundance of mature myostatin rather than total myostatin is negatively associated with bone mineral density in Chinese.\nMyostatin is mainly secreted by skeletal muscle and negatively regulates skeletal muscle growth. However, the roles of myostatin on bone metabolism are still largely unknown. Here, we recruited two large populations containing 6308 elderly Chinese and conducted comprehensive statistical analyses to evaluate the associations among lean body mass (LBM), plasma myostatin, and bone mineral density (BMD). Our data revealed that total myostatin in plasma was mainly determined by LBM. The relative abundance of mature myostatin (mature/total) was significantly lower in high versus low BMD subjects. Moreover, the relative abundance of mature myostatin was positively correlated with bone resorption marker. Finally, we carried out in vitro experiments and found that myostatin has inhibitory effects on the proliferation and differentiation of human osteoprogenitor cells. Taken together, our results have demonstrated that the relative abundance of mature myostatin in plasma is negatively associated with BMD, and the underlying functional mechanism for the association is most likely through inhibiting osteoblastogenesis and promoting osteoclastogenesis.",
  "A Best-Worst Measure of Attitudes toward Buying Seabream and Seabass Products: An Application to the Island of Gran Canaria.\nAttitudes are important key drivers that affect consumers' seafood consumption. The present investigation used a best-worst scaling approach to measure the level of importance and satisfaction of consumers' attitudes towards the purchase of seabream and seabass in Gran Canaria (Spain). The investigation also compared the results of the best-worst scaling (BWS) approach with those of the traditional Likert-scale method and offers a different perspective of the results using an Importance-Satisfaction Analysis (ISA). The results indicate that the most important attributes concerned the hygiene and safety of the product, the health benefits, the freshness, the taste and the nutrients. At the same time, these attributes were ranked as those which satisfied consumers the most. However, some of the results obtained from the methodologies differed. The results suggest that, in the Likert-scale task, respondents might be overstating the importance and satisfaction of the attributes; while in the BWS, consumers were forced to evaluate a trade-off in the selection of the best and worst attributes in each scenario, so the task impeded, in principle, to define every attribute as very important and providing a high satisfaction. As a result, we consider that BWS offers more reliable and clearer results than traditional Likert-scale experiments.",
  "Synthesis of C-Plane Oriented Hexagonal Tungsten Oxide Membranes on Tubular Substrates and Their Acetic Acid/Water Separation Performances.\nHexagonal tungsten oxide (h-WO<sub>3</sub>) membrane is a novel candidate for dehydration of acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH)/water mixtures owing to its molecular sieving property and acidic resistance. Meanwhile, c-plane orientation is an important factor for h-WO<sub>3</sub> membranes because the pores of h-WO<sub>3</sub> run along its c-axis. However, so far, high c-plane orientation has not been successful on tubular substrates. Here, the effect of synthesis conditions of h-WO<sub>3</sub> membranes on tubular substrates against c-plane orientation and CH<sub>3</sub>COOH/water separation performance are investigated. The h-WO<sub>3</sub> membranes were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis from a precursor sol containing various amounts of sodium tungstate (Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>) in the presence of tubular substrates with seeds embedded on their outside surface. The seeding method and the amount of Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> in the precursor sol significantly affected both crystal orientation and densification of the membrane. A precursor sol with appropriate amounts of Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> was essential to simultaneously satisfy high c-plane orientation and densification of the membrane while excess Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> drastically decreased the degree of c-plane orientation. A highly c-plane oriented h-WO<sub>3</sub> membrane was successfully obtained under the optimized condition, which exhibited a maximum separation factor of 40.0 and a water permeance of 1.53 &#215; 10<sup>-7</sup> mol&#183;m<sup>-2</sup>&#183;s<sup>-1</sup>&#183;Pa<sup>-1</sup> in a 90:10 wt % CH<sub>3</sub>COOH/water mixture. The water permeance approximately doubled compared to the previous report, possibly owing to the significantly higher degree of c-plane orientation. Furthermore, it was found that its separation ability can be maintained while stored in 90:10 wt % CH<sub>3</sub>COOH/water mixture with pH &lt; 0 for more than 500 h.",
  "Assessing the Security of Campus Networks: The Case of Seven Universities.\nThe network security situation of campus networks on CERNET (China Education and Research Network) has received great concern. However, most network managers have no complete picture of the network security because of its special management and the rapid growth of network assets. In this investigation, the security of campus networks belonging to seven universities in Wuhan was investigated. A tool called \"WebHunt\" was designed for campus networks, and with its help, the network security risks were found. Differently from existing tools for network probing, WebHunt can adopt the network scale and special rules of the campus network. According to the characteristics of campus websites, a series of functions were integrated into WebHunt, including reverse resolution of domain names, active network detection and fingerprint identification for software assets. Besides, WebHunt builds its vulnerability intelligence database with a knowledge graph structure and locates the vulnerabilities through matching knowledge graph information. Security assessments of seven universities presents WebHunt's applicability for campus networks. Besides, it also shows that many security risks are concealed in campus networks, such as non-compliance IP addresses and domain names, system vulnerabilities and so on. The security reports containing risks have been sent to the relevant universities, and positive feedback was received.",
  "Plant extracts as a natural treatment against the fish ectoparasite Neobenedenia sp. (Monogenea: Capsalidae).\nThe toxicity of water-ethanol extracts of garlic (Allium sativum), ginger (Zingiber officinale), basil (Ocimum basilicum), bitter chaparro (Castela tortuousa), onion (Allium cepa) and papaya (Carica papaya) against adults, eggs and oncomiracidia of Neobenedenia spp. parasites was examined. Parasites were exposed to continuous immersion and treated as follows: extracts were tested at three dilutions: 1:10, 1:50 and 1:100 made with filtered seawater (35 g l-1); ethanol (70%) was evaluated at the same dilutions of 1:10 (7% ethanol), 1:50 (1.4% ethanol) and 1:100 (0.07% ethanol) and a seawater (35 g l-1) control. The antiparasitic effect was measured on: (1) adult survival, egg production and time to detachment from the culture vessel; (2) egg development and cumulative egg hatching; and (3) oncomiracidia survival. All three dilutions of ginger and dilutions 1:100 and 1:50 of basil extract reduced adult survival in vitro, time to detachment from the surface of the culture vessel, egg production and oncomiracidia survival. Bitter chaparro extract reduced adult egg production and oncomiracidia survival. Hatching success was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) in basil extract (1:100) to 86.6% compared to the seawater control (100%). Dilutions 1:10 of ginger and basil exhibited the highest impact on the biological parameters of Neobenedenia sp. Our study demonstrates that water-ethanol extracts of ginger, basil and bitter chaparro are toxic against Neobenedenia sp. life stages.",
  "Readmissions With Multidrug-Resistant Infection in Patients With Prior Multidrug Resistant Infection.\nOBJECTIVE To determine incidence of and risk factors for readmissions with multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections among patients with previous MDRO infection. DESIGN Retrospective cohort of patients admitted between January 1, 2006, and October 1, 2015. SETTING Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1,250-bed academic tertiary referral center in St Louis, Missouri. METHODS We identified patients with MDROs obtained from the bloodstream, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)/bronchial wash, or other sterile sites. Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) and European CDC definitions of MDROs were utilized. All readmissions ≤1 year from discharge from the index MDRO hospitalization were evaluated for bloodstream, BAL/bronchial wash, or other sterile site cultures positive for the same or different MDROs. RESULTS In total, 4,429 unique patients had a positive culture for an MDRO; 3,453 of these (78.0%) survived the index hospitalization. Moreover, 2,127 patients (61.6%) were readmitted ≥1 time within a year, for a total of 5,849 readmissions. Furthermore, 512 patients (24.1%) had the same or a different MDRO isolated from blood, BAL/bronchial wash, or another sterile site during a readmission. Bone marrow transplant, end-stage renal disease, lymphoma, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa during index hospitalization were factors associated with increased risk of having an MDRO isolated during a readmission. MDROs isolated during readmissions were in the same class of MDRO as the index hospitalization 9%-78% of the time, with variation by index pathogen. CONCLUSIONS Readmissions among patients with MDRO infections are frequent. Various patient and organism factors predispose to readmission. When readmitted patients had an MDRO, it was often a pathogen in the same class as that isolated during the index admission, with the exception of Acinetobacter (~9%).

  "Strawberry Decreases Intraluminal and Intestinal Wall Hydrolysis of Testosterone Undecanoate.\nMale hypogonadism is often treated by testosterone (T) replacement therapy such as oral administration of the ester prodrug, testosterone undecanoate (TU). However, the systemic exposure to T following oral TU is very low due to esterase-mediated metabolism, particularly in the small intestine. The aim of this work was to examine the esterase-inhibitory effect of natural fruit extract of strawberry (STW) on the intestinal degradation of TU as a potential approach to increasing the oral bioavailability of T. Herein, the hydrolysis of TU was assessed in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid with added esterase activity (FaSSIF/ES) and Caco-2 cell homogenates in the presence of STW extract. It is noteworthy that STW substantially inhibited the degradation of TU in FaSSIF/ES and Caco-2 cell homogenates at concentrations that could be achieved following oral consumption of less than one serving of STW fruit. This can significantly increase the fraction of unhydrolyzed TU in the intestinal lumen as well as in enterocytes. In addition, it was demonstrated that TU has high intestinal lymphatic transport potential as the association of TU with plasma-derived human chylomicrons was in the range of 84%. Therefore, oral co-administration of TU with STW could potentially increase the intestinal stability of TU and consequently the contribution of lymphatically delivered TU to the systemic exposure of T in vivo.",
  "Consumer evaluation of 'Veggycation<sup>&#174;</sup>', a website promoting the health benefits of vegetables.\nIssue addressed Whether the website Veggycation<sup>&#174;</sup> appeals to particular groups of consumers significantly more than other groups. Methods Australian adults aged &#8805;18 years (n = 1000) completed an online survey. The website evaluation instrument used was tested for validity and reliability. Associations between demographic variables and website evaluation dimensions of attractiveness, content, user-friendliness and loyalty intentions were examined using a general linear model (GLM). The appraisal of the website was further investigated based on the respondents' daily consumption level of vegetables and the importance they attach to vegetable consumption in their diet, using GLM and a Tukey's all-pair comparison. Results Veggycation<sup>&#174;</sup> has a high level of acceptance among the Australian community with certain groups evaluating the website more favourably. These include women, people aged&#8804;29 years, higher income respondents, non-metro respondents and those who viewed vegetables as extremely important in their daily diet. Conclusions Customisation of the website for consumer groups with low vegetable consumption is recommended. Designing tailored communication tools will assist in enhancing the knowledge base of vegetable-related health benefits and may promote vegetable consumption among the Australian population. So what? The promotion of higher vegetable consumption is aided by tailored, well-designed web communication. This study adds to the existing body of knowledge for the education of organisations developing e-tools for promoting health education and literacy.",
  "Achieving equity in Crunch&amp;Sip<sup>&#174;</sup>: a pilot intervention of supplementary free fruit and vegetables in NSW classrooms.\nIssue addressed Anecdotal evidence from teachers in Western Sydney Local Health District (WSLHD) indicated that many primary school children are regularly unable to participate in the Crunch&amp;Sip<sup>&#174;</sup> (C&amp;S) program (breaks during class time to eat fruit and/or vegetables and drink water) as they do not bring produce from home. Actual reach of the program may therefore be currently overestimated, and inequitable. This study examined the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of providing school children supplementary, fresh free produce in supporting equitable participation in C&amp;S. Methods Free fruit and vegetables were provided for 10 weeks to four schools in a socioeconomically-disadvantaged area in Western Sydney. WSLHD sourced the produce at a discounted rate and storage and distribution was arranged in partnership with industry. Schools determined methods of allocation to children who did not have fruit or vegetables for the C&amp;S break. Pre- and late-intervention (Week 9) classroom surveys provided quantitative data of intervention efficacy. Qualitative methods were used with key school persons to explore barriers and enablers to implementation. Results Participation of children in C&amp;S increased significantly from 46.7% pre-intervention to 92.0% in Week 9. The proportion of children bringing fruit or vegetables from home also increased significantly, from 46.7% to 54.0%. Schools perceived the supplementary strategy to be highly feasible and acceptable. Conclusion Expansion of this equity strategy warrants consideration, although issues of sustainability would need to be addressed. The criteria for 'full implementation' should include high proportional participation by students in participating classes. So what? Establishing a system by which schools in disadvantaged areas can supplement their C&amp;S program would effectively increase access to fruit and vegetables among those children most at need.",
  "Classification of Congeneric and QSAR of Homologous Antileukemic <i>S</i>-Alkylcysteine Ketones.\nBased on a set of six vector properties, the partial correlation diagram is calculated for a set of 28 <i>S</i>-alkylcysteine diazomethyl- and chloromethyl-ketone derivatives. Those with the greatest antileukemic activity in the same class correspond to high partial correlations. A periodic classification is performed based on information entropy. The first four characteristics denote the group, and the last two indicate the period. Compounds in the same period and, especially, group present similar properties. The most active substances are situated at the bottom right. Nine classes are distinguished. The principal component analysis of the homologous compounds shows five subclasses included in the periodic classification. Linear fits of both antileukemic activities and stability are good. They are in agreement with the principal component analysis. The variables that appear in the models are those that show positive loading in the principal component analysis. The most important properties to explain the antileukemic activities (50% inhibitory concentration Molt-3 T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia minus the logarithm of 50% inhibitory concentration Nalm-6 B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia and stability <i>k</i>) are ACD log<i>D</i>, surface tension and number of violations of Lipinski's rule of five. After leave-<i>m</i>-out cross-validation, the most predictive model for cysteine diazomethyl- and chloromethyl-ketone derivatives is provided.",
  "Cooperation between ER stress and calcineurin signaling contributes to the maintenance of cell wall integrity in Candida glabrata.\nCandida glabrata is the second most common source of Candida infections in humans. In this pathogen, the maintenance of cell wall integrity (CWI) frequently precludes effective pharmacological treatment by antifungal agents. In numerous fungi, cell wall modulation is reported to be controlled by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, but how the latter affects CWI maintenance in C. glabrata is not clearly understood. Here, we characterized a C. glabrata strain harboring a mutation in the CNE1 gene, which encodes a molecular chaperone associated with nascent glycoprotein maturation in the ER. Disruption of cne1 induced ER stress and caused changes in the normal cell wall structure, specifically a reduction in the β-1,6-glucan content and accumulation of chitin. Conversely, a treatment with the typical ER stress inducer tunicamycin up-regulated the production of cell wall chitin but did not affect β-1,6-glucan content. Our results also indicated that C. glabrata features a uniquely evolved ER stress-mediated CWI pathway, which differs from that in the closely related species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ER stress-mediated CWI pathway in C. glabrata is also induced by the disruption of other genes encoding proteins that function in a correlated manner in the quality control of N-linked glycoproteins in the ER. These results suggest that calcineurin and ER quality control system act as a platform for maintaining CWI in C. glabrata.",
  "A phylogenetic and morphological overview of sections Bohusia, Sanguinolenti, and allied sections within Agaricus subg. Pseudochitonia with three new species from France, Iran, and Portugal.\nThe genus Agaricus was recently rearranged to accommodate numerous tropical taxa. Accordingly, the genus was split into six subgenera and 22 sections of which 12 are included in A. subg. Pseudochitonia. Preliminary data indicated that three putative new species belong to this subgenus. Our objectives were to describe these species, to determine to which sections they belong, and to experience the interest of some traditional traits in this new context. We morphologically described Agaricus coniferarum from France and Portugal, Agaricus iranicus from Iran, and Agaricus lusitanicus from Portugal. Multi-gene phylogenetic analyses based on ITS, LSU, and tef1 sequence data of representatives of the 12 sections clearly indicated that A. coniferarum and A. lusitanicus are placed in Agaricus sect. Bohusia, while A. iranicus is in A. sect. Sanguinolenti. Incidentally, we replaced the illegitimate name Agaricus magnivelaris by Agaricus fiardianus. In a phylogenetic tree, based on all available ITS sequence data and focussing on six related sections, we examined the phylogenetic distribution of various characters. The intensity of red discolouration when the sporocarp is rubbed or cut appeared as a phylogenetically weak informative trait. We propose a determination key leading to a group of three hardly distinguishable sections (Bohusia, Nigrobrunnescentes, and Sanguinolenti).",
  "Hybrid Blockchain for IoT-Energy Analysis and Reward Plan.\nBlockchain technology has brought significant advantages for security and trustworthiness, in particular for Internet of Things (IoT) applications where there are multiple organisations that need to verify data and ensure security of shared smart contracts. Blockchain technology offers security features by means of consensus mechanisms; two key consensus mechanisms are, Proof of Work (PoW) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). While the PoW based mechanism is computationally intensive, due to the puzzle solving, the PBFT consensus mechanism is communication intensive due to the all-to-all messages; thereby, both may result in high energy consumption and, hence, there is a trade-off between the computation and the communication energy costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid-blockchain (H-chain) framework appropriate for scenarios where multiple organizations exist and where the framework enables private transaction verification and public transaction sharing and audit, according to application needs. In particular, we study the energy consumption of the hybrid consensus mechanisms in H-chain. Moreover, this paper proposes a reward plan to incentivize the blockchain agents so that they make contributions to the H-chain while also considering the energy consumption. While the work is generally applicable to IoT applications, the paper illustrates the framework in a scenario which secures an IoT application connected using a software defined network (SDN). The evaluation results first provide a method to balance the public and private parts of the H-chain deployment according to network conditions, computation capability, verification complexity, among other parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that the reward plan can incentivize the blockchain agents to contribute to the H-chain considering the energy consumption of the hybrid consensus mechanism, this enables the proposed H-chain to achieve optimal social welfare.",
  "Influence of the Bearing Thermal Deformation on Nonlinear Dynamic Characteristics of an Electric Drive Helical Gear System.\nBased on the statics and quasi-statics analysis methods, the thermal deformation calculation model of a deep-groove ball bearing was constructed for the helical gear transmission system of a high speed electric drive, and the radial and axial bearing stiffness values of the bearing were calculated under the thermal deformation in this study. The obtained radial and axial stiffness values were introduced into the established dynamics model of helical gear system, and the influence of changed bearing stiffness, resulting from the thermal deformation, on the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of gear pair was analyzed using the Runge-Kutta method. The results show that the axial and radial deformations of bearing occur due to the increase of working speed and temperature, in which the axial stiffness of bearing is improved but the radial stiffness is reduced. The decreasing degree of axial stiffness and the increasing degree of radial stiffness decrease with the gradually increasing working rotational speed. When considering the influence of thermal deformation on the bearing stiffness, the helical gear system will have nonlinear behaviors, such as single periodic, double periodic, and chaotic motion with the change of working speed. Therefore, in order to improve the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of high speed electric drive gear systems, the influence of bearing stiffness change on the dynamic performance of a gear system should be considered in the industrial applications.",
  "Hodgkin lymphoma: A complex metabolic ecosystem with glycolytic reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment.\nTwenty percent of patients with classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) have aggressive disease defined as relapsed or refractory disease to initial therapy. At present we cannot identify these patients pre-treatment. The microenvironment is very important in cHL because non-cancer cells constitute the majority of the cells in these tumors. Non-cancer intra-tumoral cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been shown to promote tumor growth in cHL via crosstalk with the cancer cells. Metabolic heterogeneity is defined as high mitochondrial metabolism in some tumor cells and glycolysis in others. We hypothesized that there are metabolic differences between cancer cells and non-cancer tumor cells, such as TAMs and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in cHL and that greater metabolic differences between cancer cells and TAMs are associated with poor outcomes.",
  "Human Nails Permeation of an Antifungal Candidate Hydroalcoholic Extract from the Plant <i>Sapindus saponaria</i> L. Rich in Saponins.\nWe evaluated a hydroalcoholic extract of <i>Sapindus saponaria</i> L. pericarps (ETHOSS), as a candidate to a topical antifungal medicine for onychomycosis. ETHOSS was produced by extracting the crushed fruits in ethanol. The saponin contents were identified and characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. We measured the in vitro antifungal activity against three dermatophyte fungi, isolated from onychomycosis: <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i>, <i>T. mentagrophytes,</i> and <i>T. interdigitale</i>, using broth microdilution tests. The minimum fungicide concentration of ETHOSS ranged from 195.31 to 781.25 &#956;g/mL. The cytotoxicity of the crude extract was tested on the HeLa cell line, and its ability to permeate into healthy human nails by photoacoustic spectroscopy and Fourier transformation infrared spectrometer (FTIR) spectroscopy by attenuated total reflection. Besides its strong antifungal activity, ETHOSS showed low cytotoxicity in human cells. It was able to permeate and reach the full thickness of the nail in one hour, without the aid of facilitating vehicles, and remained there for at least 24 h. These results suggest that ETHOSS has great potential for treating onychomycosis.",
  "Renal replacement therapy for AKI: When? How much? When to stop?\nSevere acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a serious clinical disorder in the intensive care unit (ICU), occurring in a significant proportion of critically ill patients. However, many questions remain about the optimal administration of RRT with regard to several important considerations, including treatment dose, timing of treatment initiation and cessation, therapy mode, type of anticoagulation, and management of fluid overload. While Level 1 evidence exists for RRT dosing in AKI, all the studies contributing to this evidence base employed fixed-dose regimens throughout a patient's continuous RRT (CRRT) course, without regard for the possibility of individualizing treatment dose according to the clinical status of a given patient at a specific time. As opposed to CRRT dose, no consensus about the timing of RRT in critically ill AKI patients exists currently. While numerous clinical trials over the past 40 years have attempted to assess \"early\" versus \"late\" initiation of RRT, they have been plagued by a myriad of methodological problems, including their largely observational nature and the widely varying definitions of early and late initiation. Although questions about the appropriate timing of CRRT discontinuation arise very frequently in clinical practice, even less information is available in the literature to guide this important decision. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on RRT delivery to critically ill AKI patients, with specific attention paid to treatment dose and timing and emphasis on addressing the practical questions that arise in daily clinical practice.",
  "Sequelae of AKI.\nLarge epidemiologic studies in a variety of patient populations reveal increased morbidity and mortality that occur months to years after an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI). Even milder forms of AKI have increased associated morbidity and mortality. Residual confounding may account for these findings, but considering the huge number of individuals afflicted with AKI, the sequelae of AKI may be a very large public health burden. AKI may simply be a marker for increased risk, but there is increasing evidence that it is part of the causal pathway to chronic kidney disease. These studies have upended the traditional view that AKI survivors who returned to baseline, or near baseline renal function, do not suffer additional long-term consequences. Recovery of renal function after AKI, short of independence from renal replacement therapy, is yet to be clearly defined but may be of significant importance in the management of AKI survivors. The association between AKI in patients who undergo cardiac surgery and clinical outcomes is of considerable importance to clinicians, surgeons, and anesthesiologists alike and is a major focus of this review.",
  "Multimodal Measurements of Single-Molecule Dynamics Using FluoRBT.\nSingle-molecule methods provide direct measurements of macromolecular dynamics, but are limited by the number of degrees of freedom that can be followed at one time. High-resolution rotor bead tracking (RBT) measures DNA torque, twist, and extension, and can be used to characterize the structural dynamics of DNA and diverse nucleoprotein complexes. Here, we extend RBT to enable simultaneous monitoring of additional degrees of freedom. Fluorescence-RBT (FluoRBT) combines magnetic tweezers, infrared evanescent scattering, and single-molecule FRET imaging, providing real-time multiparameter measurements of complex molecular processes. We demonstrate the capabilities of FluoRBT by conducting simultaneous measurements of extension and FRET during opening and closing of a DNA hairpin under tension, and by observing simultaneous changes in FRET and torque during a transition between right-handed B-form and left-handed Z-form DNA under controlled supercoiling. We discover unanticipated continuous changes in FRET with applied torque, and also show how FluoRBT can facilitate high-resolution FRET measurements of molecular states, by using a mechanical signal as an independent temporal reference for aligning and averaging noisy fluorescence data. By combining mechanical measurements of global DNA deformations with FRET measurements of local conformational changes, FluoRBT will enable multidimensional investigations of systems ranging from DNA structures to large macromolecular machines.",
  "Intracerebroventricular Treatment with 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin Decreased Cerebellar and Hepatic Glycoprotein Nonmetastatic Melanoma Protein B (GPNMB) Expression in Niemann-Pick Disease Type C Model Mice.\nNiemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a recessive hereditary disease caused by mutation of the <i>NPC1</i> or <i>NPC2</i> gene. It is characterized by abnormality of cellular cholesterol trafficking with severe neuronal and hepatic injury. In this study, we investigated the potential of glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) to act as a biomarker reflecting the therapeutic effect of 2-hydroxypropyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin (HP-&#946;-CD) in an NPC mouse model. We measured serum, brain, and liver expression levels of GPNMB, and evaluated their therapeutic effects on NPC manifestations in the brain and liver after the intracerebroventricular administration of HP-&#946;-CD in <i>Npc1</i> gene-deficient (<i>Npc1</i><sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Intracerebroventricular HP-&#946;-CD inhibited cerebellar Purkinje cell damage in <i>Npc1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice and significantly reduced serum and cerebellar GPNMB levels. Interestingly, we also observed that the intracerebral administration significantly reduced hepatic GPNMB expression and elevated serum ALT in <i>Npc1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Repeated doses of intracerebroventricular HP-&#946;-CD (30 mg/kg, started at 4 weeks of age and repeated every 2 weeks) drastically extended the lifespan of <i>Npc1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with saline treatment. In summary, our results suggest that GPNMB level in serum is a potential biomarker for evaluating the attenuation of NPC pathophysiology by intracerebroventricular HP-&#946;-CD treatment.",
  "Relative position control design of receiver UAV in flying-boom aerial refueling phase.\nThis paper proposes the design of the relative position-keeping control of the receiver unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with the time-varying mass in the refueling phase utilizing an inner-outer loop structure. Firstly, the model of the receiver in the refueling phase is established. And then tank model is set up to analyze the influence of fuel transfer on the receiver. Subsequently, double power reaching law based sliding mode controller is designed to control receiver translational motion relative to tanker aircraft in the outer loop while active disturbance rejection control technique is applied to the inner loop to stabilize the receiver. In addition, the closed-loop stabilities of the subsystems are established, respectively. Finally, an aerial refueling model under various refueling strategies is utilized. Simulations and comparative analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controllers.",
  "Calvarium mass as the first presentation of glioblastoma multiforme: A very rare manifestation of high-grade glioma.\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a high grade glial tumor, primarily located in cerebral hemispheres. The most common clinical presentations are slowly progressive neurological deficit such as motor weakness, seizure, and headaches that last less than three months. Calvarium and extra-axial invasion are very rare and generally occur after a brain biopsy or surgery, or secondary to radiotherapy of primary intra-axial glial tumors. We report a case of GBM with calvarium involvement in a 60-year-old man who presented with a frontal bump and left-sided clumsiness. Imaging studies revealed a tumoral lesion that destroyed the frontal bone with white matter involvement of the frontal lobe and extension into the corpus callosum. Histopathological examination of intra-axial and extra-axial lesions revealed pleomorphic high-grade tumor with large areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. Immunohistochemical (IHC) studies confirmed GBM that spread directly into the dura, galea, and calvarium (positive reaction for GFAP, S-100, CD68, OLIG2, and p53). The patient was treated with radiotherapy (60Gy/30 fractions) and concomitant temozolomide. Unfortunately, the patient died seven months after the initial diagnosis.",
  "Manipulating post-stroke gait: Exploiting aberrant kinematics.\nPost-stroke individuals often exhibit abnormal kinematics, including increased pelvic obliquity and hip abduction coupled with reduced knee flexion. Prior examinations suggest these behaviors are expressions of abnormal cross-planar coupling of muscle activity. However, few studies have detailed the impact of gait-retraining paradigms on three-dimensional joint kinematics. In this study, a cross-tilt walking surface was examined as a novel gait-retraining construct. We hypothesized that relative to baseline walking kinematics, exposure to cross-tilt would generate significant changes in subsequent flat-walking joint kinematics during affected limb swing. Twelve post-stroke participants walked on a motorized treadmill platform during a flat-walking condition and during a 10-degree cross-tilt with affected limb up-slope, increasing toe clearance demand. Individuals completed 15 min of cross-tilt walking with intermittent flat-walking catch trials and a final washout period (5 min). For flat-walking conditions, we examined changes in pelvic obliquity, hip abduction/adduction and knee flexion kinematics at the spatiotemporal events of swing initiation and toe-off, and the kinematic event of maximum angle during swing. Pelvic obliquity significantly reduced at swing initiation and maximum obliquity in the final catch trial and late washout. Knee flexion significantly increased at swing initiation, toe-off, and maximum flexion across catch trials and late washout. Hip abduction/adduction was not significantly influenced following cross-tilt walking. Significant decrease in the rectus femoris and medial hamstrings muscle activity across catch trials and late washout was observed. Exploiting the abnormal features of post-stroke gait during retraining yielded desirable changes in muscular and kinematic patterns post-training.",
  "A Hybrid Approach to Industrial Augmented Reality Using Deep Learning-Based Facility Segmentation and Depth Prediction.\nTypical AR methods have generic problems such as visual mismatching, incorrect occlusions, and limited augmentation due to the inability to estimate depth from AR images and attaching the AR markers onto physical objects, which prevents the industrial worker from conducting manufacturing tasks effectively. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to industrial AR for complementing existing AR methods using deep learning-based facility segmentation and depth prediction without AR markers and a depth camera. First, the outlines of physical objects are extracted by applying a deep learning-based instance segmentation method to the RGB image acquired from the AR camera. Simultaneously, a depth prediction method is applied to the AR image to estimate the depth map as a 3D point cloud for the detected object. Based on the segmented 3D point cloud data, 3D spatial relationships among the physical objects are calculated, which can assist in solving the visual mismatch and occlusion problems properly. In addition, it can deal with a dynamically operating or a moving facility, such as a robot-the conventional AR cannot do so. For these reasons, the proposed approach can be utilized as a hybrid or complementing function to existing AR methods, since it can be activated whenever the industrial worker requires handing of visual mismatches or occlusions. Quantitative and qualitative analyses verify the advantage of the proposed approach compared with existing AR methods. Some case studies also prove that the proposed method can be applied not only to manufacturing but also to other fields. These studies confirm the scalability, effectiveness, and originality of this proposed approach.",
  "Towards a Robust Visual Place Recognition in Large-Scale vSLAM Scenarios Based on a Deep Distance Learning.\nThe application of deep learning is blooming in the field of visual place recognition, which plays a critical role in visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) applications. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve better performance than handcrafted feature descriptors. However, visual place recognition is still a challenging task due to two major problems, i.e., perceptual aliasing and perceptual variability. Therefore, designing a customized distance learning method to express the intrinsic distance constraints in the large-scale vSLAM scenarios is of great importance. Traditional deep distance learning methods usually use the triplet loss which requires the mining of anchor images. This may, however, result in very tedious inefficient training and anomalous distance relationships. In this paper, a novel deep distance learning framework for visual place recognition is proposed. Through in-depth analysis of the multiple constraints of the distance relationship in the visual place recognition problem, the multi-constraint loss function is proposed to optimize the distance constraint relationships in the Euclidean space. The new framework can support any kind of CNN such as AlexNet, VGGNet and other user-defined networks to extract more distinguishing features. We have compared the results with the traditional deep distance learning method, and the results show that the proposed method can improve the performance by 19-28%. Additionally, compared to some contemporary visual place recognition techniques, the proposed method can improve the performance by 40%/36% and 27%/24% in average on VGGNet/AlexNet using the New College and the TUM datasets, respectively. It's verified the method is capable to handle appearance changes in complex environments.",
  "Influence of ad libitum milk replacer feeding and butyrate supplementation on the systemic and hepatic insulin-like growth factor I and its binding proteins in Holstein calves.\nAd libitum milk feeding and butyrate (B) supplementation have the potential to stimulate postnatal growth and development in calves. The somatotropic axis is the main endocrine regulator of postnatal growth and may be affected by both ad libitum milk replacer (MR) feeding and B supplementation in calves. We hypothesized that ad libitum MR feeding and B supplementation stimulate systemic and hepatic insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) in preweaning calves. Sixty-four (32 male, 32 female) Holstein calves were examined from birth until wk 11 of life. Calves received MR either ad libitum (Adl) or restrictively (6 L/d; Res). In each feeding group half of the calves received a MR with 0.24% butyrate and the other half received same MR without butyrate. Ad libitum MR feeding was performed from d 4 until wk 8 of age. From wk 9 to 10, Adl and Res calves were gradually weaned and were fed 2 L/d until the end of the trial. Concentrate, hay, and water were freely available. Feed intake was measured daily and body weight weekly. Blood samples for analyzing plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, IGF-I, and IGFBP-2, -3, and -4 were taken on d 1, 2, 4, and 7, then weekly or every other week (IGFBP) until wk 11 of life. Liver samples were taken on d 50 and at the end of the study (d 80) to measure gene expression of the growth hormone receptor 1A (GHR1A), IGF1, IGFBP1 to 4, and of the IGF Type 1 and insulin receptor in the liver. Intake of MR and body weight were greater, but concentrate intake was lower in Adl than in Res. Plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were greater and plasma concentration of IGFBP-2 was lower in Adl than in Res during the ad libitum milk feeding period. After reduction of MR in both groups to 2 L/d plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-4 were lower and plasma concentration of IGFBP-2 was higher in Adl than in Res. Supplementation of B depressed plasma IGF-I from wk 1 to 4 and in wk 9. On d 50, mRNA abundance of the GHR1A and IGF1 was greater and of IGFBP2 mRNA was lower in Adl than in Res. At d 80, IGFBP2 mRNA was greater in Adl than in Res, and IGFBP2 mRNA increased with B supplementation. Ad libitum MR feeding stimulated the systemic and hepatic IGF system and mirrored the greater growth rate during the ad libitum MR feeding, whereas butyrate supplementation partly reduced the systemic and hepatic IGF system.",
  "Effect of leaving milk trucks empty and idle for 6 h between raw milk loads.\nThe US Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) allows milk tanker trucks to be used repeatedly for 24 h before mandatory clean-in-place cleaning, but no specifications are given for the length of time a tanker can be empty between loads. We defined a worst-case hauling scenario as a hauling vessel left empty and dirty (idle) for extended periods between loads, especially in warm weather. Initial studies were conducted using 5-gallon milk cans (pilot-scale) as a proof-of-concept and to demonstrate that extended idle time intervals could contribute to compromised raw milk quality. Based on pilot-scale results, a commercial hauling study was conducted through partnership with a Pacific Northwest dairy co-op to verify that extended idle times of 6 h between loads have minimal influence on the microbiological populations and enzyme activity in subsequent loads of milk. Milk cans were used to haul raw milk (load 1), emptied, incubated at 30°C for 3, 6, 10, and 20 h, and refilled with commercially pasteurized whole milk (load 2) to measure cross-contamination. For the commercial-scale study, a single tanker was filled with milk from a farm known to have poorer quality milk (farm A, load 1), emptied, and refilled immediately (0 h) or after a delay (6 h) with milk from a farm known to have superior quality milk (farm B, load 2). In both experiments, milk samples were obtained from each farm's bulk tank and from the milk can or tanker before unloading. Each sample was microbiologically assessed for standard plate count (SPC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and coliform counts. Selected isolates were assessed for lipolytic and proteolytic activity using spirit blue agar and skim milk agar, respectively. The pilot-scale experiment effectively demonstrated that extended periods of idle (>3 h) of soiled hauling vessels can significantly affect the microbiological quality of raw milk in subsequent loads; however, extended idle times of 6 h or less would not measurably compromise milk quality in subsequent loads in commercial tankers. Current tanker sanitation practices appear to be sufficient for maintaining raw milk SPC, LAB, and coliform levels, which are important measures of milk quality.",
  "Dynamics of methanogenesis, ruminal fermentation, and alfalfa degradation during adaptation to monensin supplementation in goats.\nThis study aimed to examine the temporal (hourly within a day and daily over the long term) effects of monensin on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, ruminal fermentation, and in situ alfalfa degradation in dairy goats during dietary monensin supplementation by controlling the confounding effects of feed intake and ambient temperature. Six ruminally cannulated dairy goats were used, and they were housed in environmental chambers and fed a restricted amount of ration throughout the experiment. The experiment included a baseline period of 20 d followed by a treatment period of 55 d with 32 mg of monensin/d. During the whole experiment, CH<sub>4</sub> production was measured every 5 d, whereas fermentation characteristics and in situ alfalfa degradation were analyzed every 10 d. The CH<sub>4</sub>-depressing effect of monensin was time dependent on the duration of treatment, highly effective at d 5 but thereafter decreased gradually until d 55 even though CH<sub>4</sub>-suppressing effect still remained significant. The decreasing effects of monensin on ruminal acetate proportion and acetate to propionate ratio also faded over days of treatment, and the acetate proportion returned up to the pre-supplementation level on d 50. Monensin supplementation elevated ruminal propionate proportion and decreased the effective ruminal degradability of alfalfa NDF, but both measurements tended to recover over time. The postprandial increase rate of hourly CH<sub>4</sub> emissions was reduced, whereas that of propionate proportion was enhanced by monensin supplementation. However, the postprandial responses to monensin in CH<sub>4</sub> emission rates, ruminal VFA profiles, and in situ degradation kinetics declined with both hours after feeding and days of treatment. Our results suggest that the CH<sub>4</sub>-suppressing effect of monensin supplementation in goats was attributed to reductions in both ruminal feed degradation and acetate to propionate ratio, but those reductions faded with time, hours after feeding, and days of treatment.",
  "An Energy-Efficient and Secure Data Inference Framework for Internet of Health Things: A Pilot Study.\nPrivacy protection in electronic healthcare applications is an important consideration, due to the sensitive nature of personal health data. Internet of Health Things (IoHT) networks that are used within a healthcare setting have unique challenges and security requirements (integrity, authentication, privacy, and availability) that must also be balanced with the need to maintain efficiency in order to conserve battery power, which can be a significant limitation in IoHT devices and networks. Data are usually transferred without undergoing filtering or optimization, and this traffic can overload sensors and cause rapid battery consumption when interacting with IoHT networks. This poses certain restrictions on the practical implementation of these devices. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving two-tier data inference framework solution that conserves battery consumption by inferring the sensed data and reducing data size for transmission, while also protecting sensitive data from leakage to adversaries. The results from experimental evaluations on efficiency and privacy show the validity of the proposed scheme, as well as significant data savings without compromising data transmission accuracy, which contributes to energy efficiency of IoHT sensor devices.",
  "Lyophilized Polyvinylpyrrolidone Hydrogel for Culture of Human Oral Mucosa Stem Cells.\nThis work shows the synthesis of a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) hydrogel by heat-activated polymerization and explores the production of hydrogels with an open porous network by lyophilisation to allow the three-dimensional culture of human oral mucosa stem cells (hOMSCs). The swollen hydrogel showed a storage modulus similar to oral mucosa and elastic solid rheological behaviour without sol transition. A comprehensive characterization of porosity by scanning electron microscopy, mercury intrusion porosimetry and nano-computed tomography (with spatial resolution below 1 &#956;m) showed that lyophilisation resulted in the heterogeneous incorporation of closed oval-like pores in the hydrogel with broad size distribution (5 to 180 &#956;m, d<sub>50</sub> = 65 &#956;m). Human oral mucosa biopsies were used to isolate hOMSCs, expressing typical markers of mesenchymal stem cells in more than 95% of the cell population. Direct contact cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that PVP hydrogel have no negative effect on cell metabolic activity, allowing the culture of hOMSCs with normal fusiform morphology. Pore connectivity should be improved in future to allow cell growth in the bulk of the PVP hydrogel.",
  "d-Glucose and amino acid deficiency inhibits casein synthesis through JAK2/STAT5 and AMPK/mTOR signaling pathways in mammary epithelial cells of dairy cows.\nAmino acids and energy deficiency lead to lower milk protein content in dairy cows. However, the known mechanisms involved in this process do not adequately explain the variability of milk protein concentration in the mammary gland. We hypothesized that a deficiency in d-glucose (d-Glc) or AA would inhibit casein synthesis by regulating signaling pathways in mammary epithelial cells. Cow mammary epithelial cells (CMEC) were subjected to combinations of 1 of 3 concentrations of d-Glc (0, 2.50, or 17.5 mM) and 1 of 3 concentrations of AA (0, 1.03, or 7.20 mM). The effect of each mixture on cell cycle stage was assessed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of &#946;-casein and &#954;-casein (encoded by CSN2 and CSN3) were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a (Stat5a), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), and eukaryotic factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) were analyzed by Western blotting. The percentages of cells in the DNA postsynthetic (G2) and DNA synthesis (S) phases would decrease, with the level of d-Glc or AA declining individually, but no interaction was observed between the d-Glc and AA effects. The CSN2 and CSN3 mRNA and protein were downregulated when d-Glc or AA decreased individually from 17.5 to 2.50 mM or from 7.20 to 1.03 mM, but d-Glc deficiency had a greater effect according to the regression analysis. The phosphorylation ratio of Jak2 (Tyr<sup>1007/1008</sup>), Stat5a (Tyr<sup>694</sup>), mTOR (Ser<sup>2448</sup>), S6K1 (Thr<sup>389</sup>), and 4EBP1 (Thr<sup>37</sup>) was downregulated with the level of d-Glc or AA decline, whereas the phosphorylation ratio of AMPK (Thr<sup>183/172</sup>) was upregulated. And the change of d-Glc level had a more marked effect than AA in regulating the activity of these signaling protein above according to the regression analysis. Thus, d-Glc or AA deficiency likely reduced casein transcription via inhibition of the Jak2/Stat5 pathway, and reduced translation via suppression of the mTOR pathway by activation of AMPK, but d-Glc deficiency had a more marked effect. These indicated that deficiency of AA, and especially Glc, suppressed proliferation of CMEC and casein gene and protein expression, associated with inhibition of JAK2/STAT5 and AMPK/mTOR signaling pathways.",
  "Increasing Oxygen Partial Pressures Induce a Distinct Transcriptional Response in Human PBMC: A Pilot Study on the \"Normobaric Oxygen Paradox\".\nThe term \"normobaric oxygen paradox\" (NOP), describes the response to the return to normoxia after a hyperoxic event, sensed by tissues as oxygen shortage, and resulting in up-regulation of the Hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) transcription factor activity. The molecular characteristics of this response have not been yet fully characterized. Herein, we report the activation time trend of oxygen-sensitive transcription factors in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy subjects after one hour of exposure to mild (MH), high (HH) and very high (VHH) hyperoxia, corresponding to 30%, 100%, 140% O<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Our observations confirm that MH is perceived as a hypoxic stress, characterized by the activation of HIF-1&#945; and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), but not Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B). Conversely, HH is associated to a progressive loss of NOP response and to an increase in oxidative stress leading to NRF2 and NF-kB activation, accompanied by the synthesis of glutathione (GSH). After VHH, HIF-1&#945; activation is totally absent and oxidative stress response, accompanied by NF-&#954;B activation, is prevalent. Intracellular GSH and Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) plasma levels parallel the transcription factors activation pattern and remain elevated throughout the observation time. In conclusion, our study confirms that, in vivo, the return to normoxia after MH is sensed as a hypoxic trigger characterized by HIF-1&#945; activation. On the contrary, HH and VHH induce a shift toward an oxidative stress response, characterized by NRF2 and NF-&#954;B activation in the first 24 h post exposure.",
  "Bio-Absorption of Human Dentin-Derived Biomaterial in Sheep Critical-Size Iliac Defects.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the bio-absorption and bone regeneration of human tooth-derived dentin scaffold, entitled as perforated root-demineralized dentin matrix (PR-DDM), after in vivo implantation into the critical-size iliac defects. The dentin scaffolds were prepared from human vital, non-functional teeth. Thirty artificial macro-pores (&#216; 1 mm) were added after removing the enamel portion. The modified teeth were supersonically demineralized in 0.34 N HNO<sub>3</sub> for 30 min. The microstructure was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The 3D micro-CT and histological analysis were carried out to evaluate the bio-absorption of PR-DDM at 2 and 4 months. A smooth dentin collagen surface with symmetrical macro-pores and tube-type dentinal tubules (&#216; 1-2 &#181;m) with micro-cracks were observed on the perforated region. A significant number of custom-made macro-pores disappeared, and the size of the macro-pores became significantly wider at 4 months compared with the 2 months (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) evaluated by 3D micro-CT. Histological images revealed the presence of multinucleated giant cells attached to the scalloped border of the PR-DDM. The morphological changes due to bio-absorption by the cellular phagocytes were comparable to the 3D micro-CT and histological images at 2 and 4 months. Altogether, the results demonstrated that the PR-DDM block was gradually absorbed by multinucleated giant cells and regenerated bone. Human PR-DDM might serve as a unique scaffold for extraoral bone regeneration.",
  "Grazing Mares on Pasture with Sycamore Maples: A Potential Threat to Suckling Foals and Food Safety through Milk Contamination.\nEquine atypical myopathy (AM) is seasonal intoxication resulting from the ingestion of seeds and seedlings of the sycamore maple (<i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i>) that contain toxins, among them, hypoglycin A (HGA). Literature mentions several cases of AM among gravid mares and in unweaned foals. The objective of this study was to determine whether HGA and/or its metabolite are present in milk from grazing mares exposed to sycamore maple trees as confirmed by detection of HGA and its metabolite in their blood. Four mare/foal couples were included in the study. Both HGA and its metabolite were detectable in all but one of the milk samples. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing transfer of HGA to the milk. This unprecedented observation could partially explain cases of unweaned foals suffering from AM. However, a transplacental transfer of the toxin cannot be excluded for newborn foals. Besides being a source of contamination for offspring, milk contamination by toxins from fruits of trees of the <i>Sapindaceae</i> family might constitute a potential risk for food safety regarding other species' raw milk or dairy products.",
  "Lightweight Cement Conglomerates Based on End-of-Life Tire Rubber: Effect of the Grain Size, Dosage and Addition of Perlite on the Physical and Mechanical Properties.\nLightweight cement mortars containing end-of-life tire rubber (TR) as aggregate were prepared and characterized by rheological, thermal, mechanical, microstructural, and wetting tests. The mixtures were obtained after total replacement of the conventional sand aggregate with untreated TR with different grain sizes (0-2 mm and 2-4 mm) and distributions (25%, 32%, and 40% by weight). The mortars showed lower thermal conductivities (≈90%) with respect to the sand reference due to the differences in the conductivities of the two phases associated with the low density of the aggregates and, to a minor extent, to the lack of adhesion of tire to the cement paste (evidenced by microstructural detection). In this respect, a decrease of the thermal conductivities was observed with the increase of the TR weight percentage together with a decrease of fluidity of the fresh mixture and a decrease of the mechanical strengths. The addition of expanded perlite (P, 0-1 mm grain size) to the mixture allowed us to obtain mortars with an improvement of the mechanical strengths and negligible modification of the thermal properties. Moreover, in this case, a decrease of the thermal conductivities was observed with the increase of the P/TR dosage together with a decrease of fluidity and of the mechanical strengths. TR mortars showed discrete cracks after failure without separation of the two parts of the specimens, and similar results were observed in the case of the perlite/TR samples thanks to the rubber particles bridging the crack faces. The super-elastic properties of the specimens were also observed in the impact compression tests in which the best performances of the tire and P/TR composites were evidenced by a deep groove before complete failure. Moreover, these mortars showed very low water penetration through the surface and also through the bulk of the samples thanks to the hydrophobic nature of the end-of-life aggregate, which makes these environmentally sustainable materials suitable for indoor and outdoor elements.",
  "Characterization of Urine Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Reveals B Cell Stimulating Cargo.\nElucidation of the biological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their potential roles in physiological and pathological processes is an expanding field of research. In this study, we characterized USC-derived EVs and studied their capacity to modulate the human immune response in vitro. We found that the USC-derived EVs are a heterogeneous population, ranging in size from that of micro-vesicles (150 nm-1 μm) down to that of exosomes (60-150 nm). Regarding their immunomodulatory functions, we found that upon isolation, the EVs (60-150 nm) induced B cell proliferation and IgM antibody secretion. Analysis of the EV contents unexpectedly revealed the presence of BAFF, APRIL, IL-6, and CD40L, all known to play a central role in B cell stimulation, differentiation, and humoral immunity. In regard to their effect on T cell functions, they resembled the function of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived EVs previously described, suppressing T cell response to activation. The finding that USC-derived EVs transport a potent bioactive cargo opens the door to a novel therapeutic avenue for boosting B cell responses in immunodeficiency or cancer.",
  "Selection, implementation, and interpretation of patient-centered shoulder and elbow outcomes.\nThe movement toward a value-based health care market requires comparison of physicians, hospitals, and health systems. Traditionally, process-based measures such as infection and readmission rates have been used. However, these events are uncommon in shoulder and elbow surgery, thus limiting their utility. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are a promising measure of quality and have been proposed as a potential metric to compare surgeon performance. However, there are over 25 different PROs for shoulder and elbow conditions. Therefore, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Value Committee was established to recommend shoulder and elbow PROs in an effort to align their implementation for quality assessment. The committee developed criteria for assessing the outcome measures including that each measure should be patient reported, not requiring clinician input; have published validation and psychometrics; and be standardized and demonstrate ease of use for the patient and clinician. Two sets were suggested: one set for clinical implementation and a more robust set for research purposes. The final recommendation was that all patients should complete the Veterans Rand 12 for general health and the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation for the specified body region. For patients with shoulder complaints, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was recommended, and for those with elbow complaints, the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was recommended. More robust disease-specific measures were provided for research purposes. Continued efforts should be made to align these measures across orthopedics to facilitate use of patient outcome measures as a component of value-based health care assessment.",
  "STAT3 Is an Upstream Regulator of <i>Granzyme G</i> in the Maternal-To-Zygotic Transition of Mouse Embryos.\nThe maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), which controls maternal signaling to synthesize zygotic gene products, promotes the preimplantation development of mouse zygotes to the two-cell stage. Our previous study reported that mouse granzyme g (Gzmg), a serine-type protease, is required for the MZT. In this study, we further identified the maternal factors that regulate the <i>Gzmg</i> promoter activity in the zygote to the two-cell stage of mouse embryos. A full-length <i>Gzmg</i> promoter from mouse genomic DNA, FL-p<i>Gzmg</i> (-1696~+28 nt), was cloned, and four deletion constructs of this <i>Gzmg</i> promoter, &#916;1-p<i>Gzmg</i> (-1369~+28 nt), &#916;2-p<i>Gzmg</i> (-939~+28 nt), &#916;3-p<i>Gzmg</i> (-711~+28 nt) and &#916;4-p<i>Gzmg</i> (-417~+28 nt), were subsequently generated. Different-sized <i>Gzmg</i> promoters were used to perform promoter assays of mouse zygotes and two-cell stage embryos. The results showed that &#916;4-p<i>Gzmg</i> promoted the highest expression level of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter in the zygotes and two-cell embryos. The data suggested that time-specific transcription factors upregulated <i>Gzmg</i> by binding cis-elements in the -417~+28-nt <i>Gzmg</i> promoter region. According to the results of the promoter assay, the transcription factor binding sites were predicted and analyzed with the JASPAR database, and two transcription factors, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and GA-binding protein alpha (GABP&#945;), were identified. Furthermore, STAT3 and GABP&#945; are expressed and located in zygote pronuclei and two-cell nuclei were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining; however, only STAT3 was recruited to the mouse zygote pronuclei and two-cell nuclei injected with the &#916;4-p<i>Gzmg</i> reporter construct. These data indicated that STAT3 is a maternal transcription factor and may upregulate <i>Gzmg</i> to promote the MZT. Furthermore, treatment with a STAT3 inhibitor, S3I-201, caused mouse embryonic arrest at the zygote and two-cell stages. These results suggest that STAT3, a maternal protein, is a critical transcription factor and regulates <i>Gzmg</i> transcription activity in preimplantation mouse embryos. It plays an important role in the maternal-to-zygotic transition during early embryonic development.",
  "Discovery of 1-(4-((3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl)amino)benzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one, an orally active multi-target agent for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.\nOxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis can cause irreversible damage on cell structure and function of kidney and are key pathological factors in Diabetic Nephropathy (DN). Therefore, multi-target agents are urgently need for the clinical treatment of DN. Using Pirfenidone as a lead compound and based on the previous research, two novel series (5-trifluoromethyl)-2(1H)-pyridone analogs were designed and synthesized. SAR of (5-trifluoromethyl)-2(1H)-pyridone derivatives containing nitrogen heterocyclic ring have been established for in vitro potency. In addition, compound 8, a novel agent that act on multiple targets of anti-DN with IC<sub>50</sub> of 90&#956;M in NIH3T3 cell lines, t<sub>1/2</sub> of 4.89&#177;1.33h in male rats and LD<sub>50</sub>&gt;2000mg/kg in mice, has been advanced to preclinical studies as an oral treatment for DN.",
  "Endometrial Status in Queens Evaluated by Histopathology Findings and Two Cytological Techniques: Low-Volume Uterine Lavage and Uterine Swabbing.\nEndometritis is associated with fertility problems in many species, with endometrial biopsy being the main diagnostic tool. In feline queens, the reduced size of the uterus may make it difficult to obtain representative diagnostic samples. Endometrial cytology may represent a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating the health status of the endometrium in queens. Fifty domestic shorthair queens were included and divided into two cytological diagnostic technique groups, the uterine lavage (UL; n = 28) and uterine swabbing (US; n = 22) groups. Cytological results were compared with histopathological and bacteriological information. Changes in the histopathological patterns were also evaluated and compared with progesterone levels to confirm previous published data. Furthermore, the results from both cytological sampling methods were compared to evaluate the utility of each method. Endometritis was ruled out in all queens by means of histology and microbiology. Leukocyte counts and red blood cell/endometrial cell ratios were significantly higher in US than UL samples. Additionally, UL sampling is less affected by blood contamination and cells are better preserved. The combination of endometrial cytology and uterine culture might be useful for evaluating the endometrial characteristics in queens. The UL evaluation method is more representative of the actual endometrial status than the US technique.",
  "Product Design to Enhance Consumer Liking of Cull Ewe Meat.\nThe global sheepmeat industry aspires to increase consumer liking for cull ewe meat and thereby increase its value; dry ageing application can increase the consumer appeal of this meat. In order to develop novel consumer-liked dry aged sheepmeat products, an innovation process aligned with design thinking principles was initiated. The objective was to understand optimal dry aged sheepmeat product formats from chef, butcher, producer and consumer perspectives, and use these findings to develop \"highly liked\" and \"premium\" dry aged cull ewe meat dishes. The methodology used and the results of stakeholder engagement, perceptual mapping, and quantitative consumer assessments are reported. Stakeholder engagement showed the importance of how novel products are introduced to the consumer and to the chef. Perceptual mapping highlighted that chef-perceived product \"premiumness\" was driven by eating quality and complexity of the dish. Consumer assessment validated these findings with increases in dish liking associated with increased premiumness and complexity in dish presentation. Overall, the described approach was successful; eight highly liked dry aged cull ewe meat dishes were developed (all scored > 7.69 on a 9-point hedonic scale for liking), and four of the eight dishes were rated \"at the level of a very premium food\".",
  "Prevalence of Self-Reported Food Allergies and Their Association with Other Health Conditions among Adults in Saudi Arabia.\nFood allergies are a potentially life-threatening health issue, and few studies have determined their prevalence throughout Saudi Arabia. The main objective of our study was to estimate the prevalence and distribution of self-reported food allergies, and explore their association with other health conditions among adults in Saudi Arabia. This study was a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted via phone interviews in June 2020. A proportional quota-sampling technique was used to obtain equal distributions of participants by age and gender across the 13 regions of Saudi Arabia. Self-reported food allergy, height, weight, health conditions, mental health status, and demographic variables were collected. Of the 6239 participants contacted, 4709 (75.48%) participants responded and completed the interview. Furthermore, 50.1% of the participants were female, with a mean age of 36.4 &#177; 13.5 years (18-90 years). The prevalence of food allergies was 19.7%. The most self-reported food allergies were egg, shellfish and shrimp, and peanuts, with a prevalence of 3.7%, 3.1%, and 3.0%, respectively. There was an association between the presence of food allergies and reported bariatric surgery, asthma, colon disease, and being at risk of depression. Bariatric surgery was significantly associated with lower likelihood of self-reported allergy (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.22-2.34, <i>p</i> = 0.002). This study revealed, for the first time, a high prevalence of self-reported food allergies among adults in Saudi Arabia in a large nationwide sample, and food allergy association with bariatric surgery, asthma, colon disease, and being at risk of depression. This information is valuable for clinicians and policymakers, particularly in terms of food allergen labeling.",
  "Metal-organic framework-derived three-dimensional porous graphitic octahedron carbon cages-encapsulated copper nanoparticles hybrids as highly efficient enrichment material for simultaneous determination of four fluoroquinolones.\nA unique 3D porous Cu@graphitic octahedron carbon cages were constructed by rapid room-temperature synthesis of a Cu-based metal-organic framework (MOF) with further pyrolysis in N<sub>2</sub>, which exhibited good enrichment ability for four fluoroquinolones (FQs) due to their superior chemical affinities to the target analytes. Applied Cu@graphitic octahedron carbon cages as adsorbent, a dispersive solid phase extraction (DSPE) method combined with HPLC was developed for detecting four FQs in real samples. Various parameters affecting residues FQs extraction efficiency were inquired in more detail. Under optimal conditions, the extraction recoveries of four FQs in chicken muscle, fish tissue, seawater and river water samples were in the range of 81.3&#8764;104.3% and the RSDs (n&#8239;=&#8239;5) were less than 5.2%. This method was successfully used to the determination of FQs in real samples.",
  "Presence of Parabens and Bisphenols in Food Commonly Consumed in Spain.\nGiven the widespread use of bisphenols and parabens in consumer products, the assessment of their intake is crucial and represents the first step towards the assessment of the potential risks that these compounds may pose to human health. In the present study, a total of 98 samples of food items commonly consumed by the Spanish population were collected from different national supermarkets and grocery stores for the determination of parabens and bisphenols. Our analysis demonstrated that 56 of the 98 food samples contained detectable levels of parabens with limits of quantification (LOQ) between 0.4 and 0.9 ng g<sup>-1</sup>. The total concentration of parabens (sum of four parabens: &#8721;parabens) ranged from below the LOQ to 281.7 ng g<sup>-1</sup>, with a mean value of 73.86 ng g<sup>-1</sup>. A total of 52% of the samples showed detectable concentrations of bisphenols. Bisphenol A (BPA) was the most frequently detected bisphenol in the food samples analysed, followed by bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol E (BPE). Bisphenol AF (BPAF), bisphenol B (BPB) and bisphenol P (BPP) were not found in any of the analysed samples. LOQ for these bisphenols were between 0.4 and 4.0 ng g<sup>-1</sup>.",
  "Numerical Analysis of Shear and Particle Crushing Characteristics in Ring Shear System Using the PFC<sup>2D</sup>.\nThe shear and particle crushing characteristics of the failure plane (or shear surface) in catastrophic mass movements are examined with a ring shear apparatus, which is generally employed owing to its suitability for large deformations. Based on results of previous experiments on waste materials from abandoned mine deposits, we employed a simple numerical model based on ring shear testing using the particle flow code (PFC<sup>2D</sup>). We examined drainage, normal stress, and shear velocity dependent shear characteristics of landslide materials. For shear velocities of 0.1 and 100 mm/s and normal stress (NS) of 25 kPa, the numerical results are in good agreement with those obtained from experimental results. The difference between the experimental and numerical results of the residual shear stress was approximately 0.4 kPa for NS equal to 25 kPa and 0.9 kPa for NS equal to 100 kPa for both drained and undrained condition. In addition, we examined particle crushing effect during shearing using the frictional work concept in PFC. We calculated the work done by friction at both peak and residual shear stresses, and then used the results as crushing criteria in the numerical analysis. The frictional work at peak and the residual shear stresses was ranged from 303 kPa&#183;s to 2579 kPa&#183;s for given drainage and normal stress conditions. These results showed that clump particles were partially crushed at peak shear stress, and further particle crushing with respect to the production of finer in shearing was recorded at residual shear stress at the shearing plane.",
  "Improvement of home composting process of food waste using different minerals.\nThis article presents the experimental study of the process of composting in a prototype home-scale system with a special focus on process improvement by using different additives (i.e. woodchips, perlite, vermiculite and zeolite). The interventions with different bulking agents were realized through composting cycles using substrates with 10% additives in specific mixtures of kitchen waste materials. The pre-selected proportion of the mixtures examined was 3:1:1 in cellulosic:proteins:carbohydrates, in order to achieve an initial C/N ratio equal to 30. The control of the initial properties of the examined substrates aimed at the consequent improvement of the properties of the final product (compost). The results indicated that composting process was enhanced with the use of additives and especially the case of zeolite and perlite provided the best results, in terms of efficient temperature evolution (>55 °C for 4 consecutive days). Carbon to nitrogen ratios decreased by 40% from the initial values for the reactors were minerals were added, while for the bioreactor tested with woodchips the reduction was slight, showing slowest degradation rate. Moisture content of produced compost varied within the range of 55-64% d.m., while nutrient content (K, Na, Ca, Mg) was in accordance with the limit values reported in literature. Finally, the composts obtained, exhibited a satisfactory degree of maturity, fulfilling the criterion related to the absence of phytotoxic compounds.",
  "Valorization of vitreous China waste to EMT/FAU, FAU and Na-P zeotype materials.\nIn this study, Na-X, Na-P, SOD and EMT/FAU zeotype materials have been prepared from vitreous China waste by conventional hydrothermal route and alkaline fusion prior to hydrothermal synthesis. The conventional route has shown its limits in the activation of the waste in the chosen experimental conditions, [NaOH]&#8239;=&#8239;3.5&#8239;M and T&#8239;=&#8239;60&#8239;&#176;C. The amorphous phase of vitreous China waste plays an important role during the zeolitization process because it easily dissolves into the alkaline solution compared to crystalline phases like quartz and mullite. By the conventional route, Na-X and Na-P1 and SOD zeolites were obtained. The alkaline fusion step using NaOH as mineralizer at 550&#8239;&#176;C converted the waste to highly active soluble aluminate and silicate salts. The fused material was mixed with distilled water to have liquid to solid ratio L/S&#8239;=&#8239;5, under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 1&#8239;day. The obtained gel with molar composition of 7.0 Na<sub>2</sub>O: 1.0 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>: 4.8 SiO<sub>2</sub>: 209.4 H<sub>2</sub>O was converted by hydrothermal crystallization at 60&#8239;&#176;C to nanosized EMT/FAU zeotype and geopolymeric amorphous aluminosilicate material. With the increase of fusion time, there is a decrease of the amount of EMT-type zeolite.",
  "Relationship between Selected Trace Elements in Human Milk and Psychosocial Characteristics in Korean Early Postpartum Women.\nThis study aimed to identify the relationship between selected trace elements in human milk and depression, breastfeeding self-efficacy, sleep satisfaction, and the demographic and obstetric characteristics of lactating mothers. Forty lactating mothers recovering after birth in two postpartum care centers located in Changwon, South Korea, were studied. Calcium, sodium, iron, and selenium concentrations in human milk were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at the analysis center of Kyungnam University. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Mann-Whiney U test, and Spearman's correlation coefficients using an SPSS 23.0 program. There were no significant differences in concentration of selected trace elements (calcium, sodium, iron, and selenium) in human milk according to demographic and obstetric characteristics. Sodium concentration was negatively correlated with breastfeeding self-efficacy (r = -0.51, CI = -0.71 to -0.24). Selenium concentration was negatively correlated with calcium concentration (r = -0.34, CI = -0.58 to 0.38). Postpartum depression was negatively correlated with sleep satisfaction (r = -0.46, CI = -0.67 to -0.17) and with breastfeeding self-efficacy (r = -0.41, CI = -0.64 to -0.11). Breastfeeding self-efficacy was positively correlated with sleep satisfaction (r = 0.48, CI = 0.20 to 0.69). This study suggests that sodium concentration in human milk is associated with breastfeeding self-efficacy.",
  "Oligosilanylated Silocanes.\nA number of mono- and dioligosilanylated silocanes were prepared. Compounds included silocanes with 1-methyl-1-tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl, 1,1-bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl], and 1,1-bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)germyl] substitution pattern as well as two examples where the silocane silicon atom is part of a cyclosilane or oxacyclosilane ring. The mono-tris(trimethylsilyl)silylated compound could be converted to the respective silocanylbis(trimethylsilyl)silanides by reaction with KO<i><sup>t</sup></i>Bu and in similar reactions the cyclosilanes were transformed to oligosilane-1,3-diides. However, the reaction of the 1,1-bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silylated] silocane with two equivalents of KO<i><sup>t</sup></i>Bu leads to the replacement of one tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl unit with a <i>tert</i>-butoxy substituent followed by silanide formation via KO<i><sup>t</sup></i>Bu attack at one of the SiMe<sub>3</sub> units of remaining tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl group. For none of the silylated silocanes, signs of hypercoordinative interaction between the nitrogen and silicon silocane atoms were detected either in the solid state. by single crystal XRD analysis, nor in solution by <sup>29</sup>Si-NMR spectroscopy. This was further confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and a DFT study, which demonstrated that the N-Si distance in silocanes is not only dependent on the energy of a potential N-Si interaction, but also on steric factors and through-space interactions of the neighboring groups at Si and N, imposing the orientation of the p<sub>z</sub>(N) orbital relative to the N-Si-X axis.",
  "Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the sellar region in adult women: Is it a sex-related disease?\nAtypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant embryonal tumor in children and a rare entity. Although adult AT/RT is extremely rare, some cases of adult-onset AT/RT in the sellar region have been described. Here, we report an adult patient with AT/RT of the sellar region in whom it was difficult to make a definitive diagnosis and the clinical course was aggressive. This is the first report of autopsy findings that could confirm the clinical characteristics of this rare unresolved pathology, and will contribute to the improvement of prognosis. In addition, a literature review was performed to clarify this exceptionally rare condition. Interestingly, all reported adult patients with sellar AT/RT, along with the present case, were female. This raises the possibility of its being a sex-related disease. However, further studies are required to come to a definitive conclusion.",
  "Effects of vector control on the population structure of tsetse (Glossina fuscipes fuscipes) in western Kenya.\nDisplacement rates of tsetse affect performance of targets during vector control. Fly size, one of the indicators of population structure usually obtained from wing measurement, is among the determinants of displacement rates. Although recovery of tsetse in previous intervention areas has been widely reported, the population structure of tsetse that recover is rarely evaluated despite being associated with displacements rates. Previously, intervention trials had reduced tsetse densities by over 90% from >3 flies/trap/day to <1fly/trap/day on Big Chamaunga and Manga islands of Lake Victoria in western Kenya. In this study, we assessed the recovery in densities of Glossina fuscipes fuscipes on the two islands and evaluated the effects vector control might have on the population structure. A before and after intervention study was undertaken on four islands of Lake Victoria in western Kenya; Small and Big Chamaunga, Manga and Rusinga Islands, two of which tsetse control intervention had previously been undertaken. Three years after intervention average G. f. fuscipes catches in biconical traps were estimated on each island. Wing centroid size (CS) (a measurement of fly size) and shape, indicators of the population structure of flies from the four islands were compared using geometric morphometric analyses. CS and shape of available female but not male tsetse wings obtained before the intervention trial on Big and Small Chamaunga islands were compared with those from the same islands after the intervention trial. G. f. fuscipes apparent density on the previous intervention islands were>9 flies/trap/day. Irrespective of sex, wing shape did not isolate tsetse based on their islands of origin. The fly size from Big and Small Chamaunga did not differ significantly before intervention trials (P = 0.728). However, three years after the intervention flies from Big Chamaunga were significantly smaller than those from Small Chamaunga (P < 0.003). Further, there was an increase in the divergence of wing morphology between flies collected from Big Chamaunga and those from Small Chamaunga after tsetse control. In conclusion, even though populations are not isolated, vector control could influence the population structure of tsetse by exerting size and wing morphology differential selection pressures. Therefore, we recommend further studies to understand the mechanism behind this as it may guide future vector control strategies.",
  "Imagery Network Fine Registration by Reference Point Cloud Data Based on the Tie Points and Planes.\nCameras and laser scanners are complementary tools for a 2D/3D information generation. Systematic and random errors cause the misalignment of the multi-sensor imagery and point cloud data. In this paper, a novel feature-based approach is proposed for imagery and point cloud fine registration. The tie points and its two neighbor pixels are matched in the overlap images, which are intersected in the object space to create the differential tie plane. A preprocessing is applied to the corresponding tie points and non-robust ones are removed. Initial coarse Exterior Orientation Parameters (EOPs), Interior Orientation Parameters (IOPs), and Additional Parameters (APs) are used to transform tie plane points to the object space. Then, the nearest points of the point cloud data to the transformed tie plane points are estimated. These estimated points are used to calculate Directional Vectors (DV) of the differential planes. As a constraint equation along with the collinearity equation, each object space tie point is forced to be located on the point cloud differential plane. Two different indoor and outdoor experimental data are used to assess the proposed approach. Achieved results show about 2.5 pixels errors on checkpoints. Such results demonstrated the robustness and practicality of the proposed approach.",
  "Mönckeberg medial calcinosis of the infraorbital arteries: a first case report.\nMönckeberg medial calcinosis describes calcifications affecting only the tunica media of medium-sized arteries. The entity is strongly associated with chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus. Radiographically, medial calcinosis presents as areas of linear calcifications in soft tissue; the linear calcifications are referred to as \"tram tracks,\" \"pipe stem,\" \"rail tracking,\" or \"tram line\" when the affected vessel is viewed longitudinally. In oral and maxillofacial radiology, it is generally an incidental finding of the facial artery. In this article, we review the literature of Mönckeberg medial calcinosis and its clinical significance related to systemic diseases; we also present a case of Mönckeberg medial calcinosis of the head and neck that affects the facial arteries, internal carotid arteries, and infraorbital arteries. We believe this is the first presentation in the literature of Mönckeberg medial calcinosis visualized in the infraorbital arteries.",
  "Making the Invisible Companion of People with Dementia Visible in Economic Studies: What Can We Learn from Social Science?\nThe dyadic perspective is important to understand the mutual influence and interdependence of both the person living with dementia and their care partner. This perspective is routinely adopted in social research programs for dementia and many dyadic interventions have been developed. However, economic evaluation and modelling to date has often failed to incorporate caregivers' perspectives, and their respective costs and outcomes while giving care for the person with dementia. On the occasions that this has been done, caregivers were represented as \"informal costs\" associated with dementia. This limited perspective cannot incorporate two-way interactions of the dyad in economic evaluations of dementia programs. This paper provides an overview of the possible interactions between people living with dementia and care partners as discovered in social science literature in the past 20 years. We demonstrate the strength of the relationships and discuss strategies for incorporating the dyadic perspective in economic evaluations of dementia programs in the future.",
  "Metaplastic Cells in the Stomach Arise, Independently of Stem Cells, via Dedifferentiation or Transdifferentiation of Chief Cells.\nSpasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) develops in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis due to infection with Helicobacter pylori; it might be a precursor to intestinal metaplasia and gastric adenocarcinoma. Lineage tracing experiments of the gastric corpus in mice have not established whether SPEM derives from proliferating stem cells or differentiated, post-mitotic zymogenic chief cells in the gland base. We investigated whether differentiated cells can give rise to SPEM using a nongenetic approach in mice. Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 5-fluorouracil, which blocked gastric cell proliferation, plus tamoxifen to induce SPEM. Based on analyses of molecular and histologic markers, we found SPEM developed even in the absence of cell proliferation. SPEM therefore did not arise from stem cells. In histologic analyses of gastric resection specimens from 10 patients with adenocarcinoma, we found normal zymogenic chief cells that were transitioning into SPEM cells only in gland bases, rather than the proliferative stem cell zone. Our findings indicate that SPEM can arise by direct reprogramming of existing cells-mainly of chief cells.",
  "Optimization of Pickling Solution for Improving the Phosphatability of Advanced High-Strength Steels.\nThis study investigated the optimum pickling conditions for improving the phosphatability of advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) using surface analysis and electrochemical measurements. To remove the SiO<sub>2</sub> that forms on the surface of AHSS, 30 wt.% NH<sub>4</sub>HF<sub>2</sub> was added to the pickling solution, resulting in a significant reduction in the amount of SiO<sub>2</sub> remaining on the surface of the AHSS. The phosphatability was improved remarkably using HNO<sub>3</sub> concentrations higher than 13% in the pickling solution. Furthermore, phosphate crystals became finer after pickling with a HNO<sub>3</sub>-based solution rather than a HCl-based solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data indicated that the corrosion resistance of AHSS subjected to HNO<sub>3</sub>-based pickling was higher than that of AHSS subjected to HCl-based pickling. Fluorine compounds, which were involved in the phosphate treatment process, were only formed on the surface of steel in HNO<sub>3</sub>-based solutions. The F compounds reacted with the phosphate solution to increase the pH of the bulk solution, which greatly improved the phosphatability. The phosphatability was better under HNO<sub>3</sub>-based conditions than a HCl-based condition due to the fineness of the phosphate structure and the increased surface roughness.",
  "γδ T Cells Contribute to Injury in the Developing Brain.\nBrain injury in premature infants, especially periventricular leukomalacia, is an important cause of neurologic disabilities. Inflammation contributes to perinatal brain injury development, but the essential mediators that lead to early-life brain injury remain largely unknown. Neonates have reduced capacity for mounting conventional αβT-cell responses. However, γδT cells are already functionally competent during early development and are important in early-life immunity. We investigated the potential contribution of γδT cells to preterm brain injury using postmortem brains from human preterm infants with periventricular leukomalacia and two animal models of preterm brain injury-the hypoxic-ischemic mouse model and a fetal sheep asphyxia model. Large numbers of γδT cells were observed in the brains of mice, sheep, and postmortem preterm infants after injury, and depletion of γδT cells provided protection in the mouse model. The common γδT-cell-associated cytokines interferon-γ and IL-17A were not detectable in the brain. Although there were increased mRNA levels of Il17f and Il22 in the mouse brains after injury, neither IL-17F nor IL-22 cytokines contributed to preterm brain injury. These findings highlight unique features of injury in the developing brain, where, unlike injury in the mature brain, γδT cells function as initiators of injury independently of common γδT-cell-associated cytokines. This finding will help to identify therapeutic targets for preventing or treating preterm infants with brain injury.",
  "A Contactless Laser Doppler Strain Sensor for Fatigue Testing with Resonance-Testing Machine.\nIn this article, a non-contact laser Doppler strain sensor designed for fatigue testing with the resonance-testing machine is presented. The compact sensor measures in-plane displacements simultaneously from two adjacent points using the principle of in-plane, laser-Doppler vibrometry. The strain is computed from the relative displacements divided by the distance between these two points. The optical design, the mathematical model for estimating noise-limited resolution, the simulation results of this model, and the first measurement results are presented. The comparison of the measurement results of our sensor with the results of a conventional strain gauge shows that our design meets the measurement requirements. The maximum strain deviation compared to conventional strain gauges of the laser-Doppler extensometer is below 4×10-5 in all performed experiments.",
  "Protective capabilities of silymarin and inulin nanoparticles against hepatic oxidative stress, genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of Deoxynivalenol in rats.\nDeoxynivalenol (DON) is a Fusarium mycotoxin that frequently contaminates cereal and cereal-based food and induces liver injury. This study evaluated the protective role of silymarin nanoparticles (SILNPs) and inulin nanoparticles (INNPs) against DON-induced liver injury in rats. Eleven groups of rats were treated orally for 3 weeks as follows: the control group, DON-treated group (5 mg/kg b.w.); INNPs-treated groups at low (LD) or high (HD) dose (100 or 200 mg/kg b.w.); SILPNs-treated group (50 mg/kg b.w.); SILNPs plus INNPs(LD) or INNPs(HD)-treated groups; INNPs(LD) or INNPs(HD) plus DON-treated groups and DON plus SILNPs and INNPs(LD) or INNPs(HD)-treated groups. Blood and tissue samples were collected for different analyses. The results revealed that the practical sizes were 200 and 98 nm for SILNPs and INNPs respectively. DON increased liver enzymes activity, lipid profile, serum cytokines, number and percentage of chromosomal aberration, DNA fragmentation and comet score. It disturbed the oxidative stress markers, down regulated gene expression and induced histological changes in the liver tissue. Treatment with DON and SILNPs and/or INNPs at the two tested doses improved all the tested parameters and SILNPs plus INNPs(HD) normalized most of these parameters in DON-treated animals. SILNPs and INNPs could be promising candidates as hepatoprotective against DON or other hepatotoxins.",
  "Kinetic Modeling and Meta-Analysis of the <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> SigB Regulon during Spore Germination and Outgrowth.\nThe exponential increase in the number of conducted studies combined with the development of sequencing methods have led to an enormous accumulation of partially processed experimental data in the past two decades. Here, we present an approach using literature-mined data complemented with gene expression kinetic modeling and promoter sequence analysis. This approach allowed us to identify the regulon of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> sigma factor SigB of RNA polymerase (RNAP) specifically expressed during germination and outgrowth. SigB is critical for the cell's response to general stress but is also expressed during spore germination and outgrowth, and this specific regulon is not known. This approach allowed us to (i) define a subset of the known SigB regulon controlled by SigB specifically during spore germination and outgrowth, (ii) identify the influence of the promoter sequence binding motif organization on the expression of the SigB-regulated genes, and (iii) suggest additional sigma factors co-controlling other SigB-dependent genes. Experiments then validated promoter sequence characteristics necessary for direct RNAP-SigB binding. In summary, this work documents the potential of computational approaches to unravel new information even for a well-studied system; moreover, the study specifically identifies the subset of the SigB regulon, which is activated during germination and outgrowth.",
  "Evolvability of the vertebrate craniofacial skeleton.\nThe skull is a vertebrate novelty. Morphological adaptations of the skull are associated with major evolutionary transitions, including the shift to a predatory lifestyle and the ability to masticate while breathing. These adaptations include the chondrocranium, dermatocranium, articulated jaws, primary and secondary palates, internal choanae, the middle ear, and temporomandibular joint. The incredible adaptive diversity of the vertebrate skull indicates an underlying bauplan that promotes evolvability. Comparative studies in craniofacial development suggest that the craniofacial bauplan includes three secondary organizers, two that are bilaterally placed at the Hinge of the developing jaw, and one situated in the midline of the developing face (the FEZ). These organizers regulate tissue interactions between the cranial neural crest, the neuroepithelium, and facial and pharyngeal epithelia that regulate the development and evolvability of the craniofacial skeleton.",
  "Alleviating the hepatotoxicity of trazodone via supramolecular encapsulation.\nIn order to develop a novel strategy to alleviate the inherent hepatotoxicity of antidepressant trazodone (TZ), Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) was adopted as pharmaceutical excipients and was studied for its capability to reduce the hepatotoxicity of TZ via supramolecular encapsulation. CB[7] was found to form strong 1:1 host-guest complexes with TZ and its metabolite m-chlorophenyl piperazine (mCPP), with binding constants of 1.50 (&#177;0.13)&#8239;&#215;&#8239;10<sup>6</sup>&#8239;M<sup>-1</sup> and 6.90 (&#177;0.49)&#8239;&#215;&#8239;10<sup>5</sup>&#8239;M<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The supramolecular complexations were examined by <sup>1</sup>H NMR and UV-visible spectroscopic titrations, ESI-MS and ITC. In the presence of 0.5&#8239;mM CB[7], the IC<sub>50</sub> values of TZ and mCPP on a human normal liver cell line L02 were increased from 215.5&#8239;&#177;&#8239;3.3&#8239;&#956;M to 544.1&#8239;&#177;&#8239;51.2&#8239;&#956;M, and from 166.8&#8239;&#177;&#8239;3.8&#8239;&#956;M to 241.7&#8239;&#177;&#8239;6.8&#8239;&#956;M, respectively. Evaluation on a zebrafish model demonstrated that CB[7] (0.1&#8239;mM) significantly alleviated the TZ induced liver toxicity, as shown by the level of liver degeneration, liver size and yolk sac retention. Our study may provide a supramolecular strategy to alleviate the hepatotoxicity induced by TZ and its metabolite mCPP, and this strategy may be extendable to other drugs that have inherent hepatotoxicity or other adverse effects.",
  "Mask R-CNN and OBIA Fusion Improves the Segmentation of Scattered Vegetation in Very High-Resolution Optical Sensors.\nVegetation generally appears scattered in drylands. Its structure, composition and spatial patterns are key controls of biotic interactions, water, and nutrient cycles. Applying segmentation methods to very high-resolution images for monitoring changes in vegetation cover can provide relevant information for dryland conservation ecology. For this reason, improving segmentation methods and understanding the effect of spatial resolution on segmentation results is key to improve dryland vegetation monitoring. We explored and analyzed the accuracy of Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask R-CNN) and the fusion of both methods in the segmentation of scattered vegetation in a dryland ecosystem. As a case study, we mapped <i>Ziziphus lotus</i>, the dominant shrub of a habitat of conservation priority in one of the driest areas of Europe. Our results show for the first time that the fusion of the results from OBIA and Mask R-CNN increases the accuracy of the segmentation of scattered shrubs up to 25% compared to both methods separately. Hence, by fusing OBIA and Mask R-CNNs on very high-resolution images, the improved segmentation accuracy of vegetation mapping would lead to more precise and sensitive monitoring of changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services in drylands.",
  "Acetylation regulates the MKK4-JNK pathway in T cell receptor signaling.\nT cell functions are regulated by multiple signaling cascades, including the MKK4-JNK (c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub> terminal kinase) pathway. However, the mechanism regulating the MKK4-JNK axis in T cells remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that protein acetylation modulates JNK activity induced by T cell receptor (TCR) activation. The acetyltransferase, CREB-binding protein (CBP), is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TCR cross-linking. To investigate the role of CBP in TCR signaling, we overexpressed CBP in the cytoplasm of Jurkat cells, a human T lymphocyte line. Enforced expression of cytoplasmic CBP led to MKK4 acetylation and interfered with MKK4-mediated JNK phosphorylation. Insufficient JNK activity decreased the activity of the transcription factor, AP-1. In contrast, other transcription factors, NF-&#954;B and NFAT, stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies were activated normally in the presence of cytoplasmic-CBP. These results provide valuable insights into the role of acetylation in MKK4-JNK signaling in T cells.",
  "A continuous assay for l-talarate/galactarate dehydratase using circular dichroism.\nl-Talarate/galactarate dehydratase (TGD) is a member of the enolase superfamily of enzymes and catalyzes the dehydration of either meso-galactarate or l-talarate to form 5-keto-4-deoxy-d-glucarate (5-KDG). To facilitate study of this enzyme and other galactarate dehydratases, a continuous circular dichroism-based assay has been developed. Using recombinant enzyme from Salmonella typhimurium (StTGD), the rates of StTGD-catalyzed conversion of m-galactarate to 5-KDG were determined by following the change in ellipticity at 323&#8239;nm. The apparent molar ellipticity ([&#952;]<sub>323</sub>) for the 5-KDG formed was determined to be 202&#8239;&#177;&#8239;2 deg cm<sup>2</sup> dmol<sup>-1</sup>, which was used to convert observed rates (&#916;&#952;/&#916;t) into concentration-dependent rates (&#916;c/&#916;t). The kinetic parameters K<sub>m</sub>, k<sub>cat</sub>, and k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> were 0.38&#8239;&#177;&#8239;0.05&#8239;mM, 4.8&#8239;&#177;&#8239;0.1 s<sup>-1</sup>, and 1.3 (&#177;0.2)&#8239;&#215;&#8239;10<sup>4</sup>&#8239;M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These values are in excellent agreement with those published previously [Yew, W.S. et al. (2007) Biochemistry46, 9564-9577] using a coupled assay system. To demonstrate the utility of the assay, the inhibition constant (K<sub>i</sub>&#8239;=&#8239;10.7&#8239;&#177;&#8239;0.4&#8239;mM) was determined for the competitive inhibitor tartronate. The continuous CD-based assay offers a practical and efficient alternative method to the coupled assay that requires access to 5-KDG aldolase, and to the labor-intensive, fixed-time assays.",
  "Daily Fluctuations of Progesterone and Testosterone Are Associated With Fibromyalgia Pain Severity.\nThe purpose of this longitudinal blood sampling study was to examine relationships between sex hormones and fibromyalgia pain. Eight women meeting case definition criteria for fibromyalgia provided venous blood samples and reported their fibromyalgia pain severity over 25 consecutive days. All women exhibited normal menstrual cycles and were not taking oral contraceptives. Cortisol, and the sex hormones estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, were assayed from serum. A linear mixed model was used to determine if fluctuations of sex hormones were associated with changes in pain severity. In the entire sample, day to day changes in progesterone (P = .002) as well as testosterone (P = .015) were significantly and inversely correlated with pain severity. There was no relationship between estradiol and pain (P = .551) or cortisol and pain (P = .633). These results suggest that progesterone and testosterone play a protective role in fibromyalgia pain severity. Sex and other hormones may serve to increase as well as decrease fibromyalgia pain severity.",
  "The brains of bats foraging at wastewater treatment works accumulate arsenic, and have low non-enzymatic antioxidant capacities.\nIncreasing rates of urbanisation cause ubiquitous infrastructures that remove anthropogenic contaminants - particularly Wastewater Treatment Works (WWTWs) - to become stressed, and hence pollute surrounding water systems. Neoromicia nana bats are suitable models to study the effects of pollution in these environments because they exploit abundant pollutant-tolerant chironomid midges that breed at WWTWs, and consequently accumulate metals such as iron, copper and zinc in their livers and kidneys. If these metals persist in their circulatory systems, and cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) they can have adverse effects on critical functions such as flight and echolocation. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential neurological effects on N. nana foraging at WWTWs versus bats at reference sites in Durban, South Africa. Our objectives were to 1) compare trace metal levels in brain and hair samples (as a proxy for circulating metals) between N. nana foraging at WWTWs and reference sites to determine if excess metals pass through the BBB via the circulatory system; and 2) compare biomarkers of neuron function (acetylcholinesterase activity), protection (antioxidant capacity), DNA integrity (DNA fragmentation), lipid integrity (lipid peroxidation) and cell viability (caspase-3 activity) between N. nana foraging at WWTW and reference sites. We found a significantly higher concentration of arsenic in hair (p < 0.05) and brain tissue (p < 0.1) of WWTW bats compared to bats at reference sites. By contrast, acetylcholinesterase activity did not differ in bats among sites and there was no evidence of significant differences in lipid peroxidation, compromised DNA integrity or apoptosis in the brains between WWTW bats and reference site bats. However, total antioxidant capacity was significantly lower in brains of WWTW bats than bats at reference sites suggesting that antioxidant protection may be compromised. Long-term exposure to environmental pollutants at WWTWs may therefore affect cellular processes and protection mechanisms in brains of N. nana bats. It may also affect other mechanisms and functions in the brain such as mitochondrial efficiency and other neurotransmitters but that remains to be tested.",
  "Discovery of Antibiofilm Activity of Elasnin against Marine Biofilms and Its Application in the Marine Antifouling Coatings.\nBiofilms are surface-attached multicellular communities that play critical roles in inducing biofouling and biocorrosion in the marine environment. Given the serious economic losses and problems caused by biofouling and biocorrosion, effective biofilm control strategies are highly sought after. In a screening program of antibiofilm compounds against marine biofilms, we discovered the potent biofilm inhibitory activity of elasnin. Elasnin effectively inhibited the biofilm formation of seven strains of bacteria isolated from marine biofilms. With high productivity, elasnin-based coatings were prepared in an easy and cost-effective way, which exhibited great performance in inhibiting the formation of multi-species biofilms and the attachment of large biofouling organisms in the marine environment. The 16S amplicon analysis and anti-larvae assay revealed that elasnin could prevent biofouling by the indirect impact of changed microbial composition of biofilms and direct inhibitory effect on larval settlement with low toxic effects. These findings indicated the potential application of elasnin in biofilm and biofouling control in the marine environment.",
  "Emerging therapies for atopic dermatitis: The prostaglandin/leukotriene pathway.\nThe role of leukotrienes and prostaglandins in development of atopy has been prototypically established in studies of asthma pathogenesis. Likewise, both in vitro and in vivo studies of atopic dermatitis have demonstrated that these molecules maintain important pathophysiologic roles. Thus, it follows that targeted therapies against these molecules may be promising in management of atopic dermatitis. Montelukast has had questionable efficacy in patients with atopic dermatitis, whereas small pilots using zileuton did have some clinically significant improvement. There are several agents in development that target leukotrienes and/or prostaglandins as well, including OC000459, Q301, and ZPL-521. In atopic dermatitis, OC000459 did not demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials, and the efficacy of the other 2 agents remains to be seen. Should these medications prove promising, these topical agents may play a future role in chronic maintenance therapy and flare prophylaxis in atopic dermatitis, as antileukotriene therapy does in asthma.",
  "Assessing the efficiency of Wolbachia driven Aedes mosquito suppression by delay differential equations.\nTo suppress wild population of Aedes mosquitoes, the primary transmission vector of life-threatening diseases such as dengue, malaria, and Zika, an innovative strategy is to release male mosquitoes carrying the bacterium Wolbachia into natural areas to drive female sterility by cytoplasmic incompatibility. We develop a model of delay differential equations, incorporating the strong density restriction in the larval stage, to assess the delicate impact of life table parameters on suppression efficiency. Through mathematical analysis, we find the sufficient and necessary condition for global stability of the complete suppression state. This condition, combined with the experimental data for Aedes albopictus population in Guangzhou, helps us predict a large range of releasing intensities for suppression success. In particular, we find that if the number of released infected males is no less than four times the number of mosquitoes in wild areas, then the mosquito density in the peak season can be reduced by 95%. We introduce an index to quantify the dependence of suppression efficiency on parameters. The invariance of some quantitative properties of the index values under various perturbations of the same parameter justifies the applicability of this index, and the robustness of our modeling approach. The index yields a ranking of the sensitivity of all parameters, among which the adult mortality has the highest sensitivity and is considerably more sensitive than the natural larvae mortality.",
  "Modeling of decision-making process for moving straight using inverse Bayesian inference.\nHumans sometimes make unreasonable decisions when viewed in objective terms. Even in the real world, we may lose sense of direction by turning around the corner several times or mistaking the estimation of travel distance. We experimented in virtual space how we lose sense of direction under what circumstances. In the experiment, subjects viewed a three-dimensional space displayed on a computer display in the first person's perspective and were instructed to go straight from the start to the goal position. Results showed that unreasonable selections that strayed from the centerline connecting the start and goal positions were frequently made. The change in the direction is more influential than the change in the distance, and the angle of turning also affects. Furthermore, the subject's decision - making process was modeled using Bayesian inference and inverse Bayesian inference. Comparing the two models, when the decision-making pattern suddenly changed, the model by inverse Bayesian inference could follow up faster than the Bayesian inference.",
  "Tryptophan Derivatives by <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> EC1118: Evaluation, Optimization, and Production in a Soybean-Based Medium.\nGiven the pharmacological properti es and the potential role of kynurenic acid (KYNA) in human physiology and the pleiotropic activity of the neurohormone melatonin (MEL) involved in physiological and immunological functions and as regulator of antioxidant enzymes, this study aimed at evaluating the capability of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> EC1118 to release tryptophan derivatives (dTRPs) from the kynurenine (KYN) and melatonin pathways. The setting up of the spectroscopic and chromatographic conditions for the quantification of the dTRPs in LC-MS/MS system, the optimization of dTRPs' production in fermentative and whole-cell biotransformation approaches and the production of dTRPs in a soybean-based cultural medium naturally enriched in tryptophan, as a case of study, were included in the experimental plan. Variable amounts of dTRPs, with a prevalence of metabolites of the KYN pathway, were detected. The LC-MS/MS analysis showed that the compound synthesized at highest concentration is KYNA that reached 9.146 &#177; 0.585 mg/L in fermentation trials in a chemically defined medium at 400 mg/L TRP. Further experiments in a soybean-based medium confirm KYNA as the main dTRPs, whereas the other dTRPs reached very lower concentrations. While detectable quantities of melatonin were never observed, two MEL isomers were successfully measured in laboratory media.",
  "Toluidine blue O modifies hippocampal amyloid pathology in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.\nRecently, we have demonstrated that toluidine blue O (TBO), a phenothiazine dye, shows inhibitory effects on both cholinesterases and amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) cellular model. In the present study, we aimed to determine the effects of TBO (in a purity of 85%) on amyloid and tau pathologies in a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD). Beginning at 7.5 (mild pathology) or 13 (severe pathology) months of age, 3xTg-AD mice were treated intraperitoneally with 4 mg/kg TBO or vehicle daily for 30 days. TBO treatment significantly reduced the levels of insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the hippocampi of mild and severe pathology groups compared to vehicle-treated counterparts. When the levels of full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) were assessed in 3xTg-AD mice at late pathological stage, no significant changes were observed after TBO treatment. Similarly, TBO did not recover hyperphosphorylation of tau at residues Thr181 and Ser202/Thr205 significantly in soluble and insoluble hippocampal fractions of 3xTg-AD mice. Taken together, the current study is the first in vivo report, to our knowledge, demonstrating that TBO mitigates amyloid pathology in 3xTg-AD mice with no apparent change on tau phosphorylation. Overall, the preliminary data presented here support the possible use of TBO as a disease-modifying drug for AD treatment.",
  "Chicken GRIFIN: Structural characterization in crystals and in solution.\nDespite its natural abundance in lenses of vertebrates the physiological function(s) of the galectin-related inter-fiber protein (GRIFIN) is (are) still unclear. The same holds true for the significance of the unique interspecies (fish/birds vs mammals) variability in the capacity to bind lactose. In solution, ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray scattering (at concentrations up to 9 mg/mL) characterize the protein as compact and stable homodimer without evidence for aggregation. The crystal structure of chicken (C-)GRIFIN at seven pH values from 4.2 to 8.5 is reported, revealing compelling stability. Binding of lactose despite the Arg71Val deviation from the sequence signature of galectins matched the otherwise canonical contact pattern with thermodynamics of an enthalpically driven process. Upon lactose accommodation, the side chain of Arg50 is shifted for hydrogen bonding to the 3-hydroxyl of glucose. No evidence for a further ligand-dependent structural alteration was obtained in solution by measuring hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometrically in peptic fingerprints. The introduction of the Asn48Lys mutation, characteristic for mammalian GRIFINs that have lost lectin activity, lets labeled C-GRIFIN maintain capacity to stain tissue sections. Binding is no longer inhibitable by lactose, as seen for the wild-type protein. These results establish the basis for detailed structure-activity considerations and are a step to complete the structural description of all seven members of the galectin network in chicken.",
  "Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Analysis in Systemic Sclerosis Reveals Hypomethylation of IFN-Associated Genes in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cells.\nEpigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. In this study, we characterized the DNA methylome in primary T cells of patients with systemic sclerosis. Genome-wide DNA methylation assays of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from 24 systemic sclerosis patients and 24 matched controls were conducted and differentially methylated regions were validated. In the discovery stage, we found that hypomethylation of genes involved in the type I IFN signaling pathway was significantly enriched in both CD4<sup>+</sup> (P&#160;= 7.59&#160;&#215; 10<sup>-6</sup>) and CD8<sup>+</sup> (P&#160;= 2.10&#160;&#215; 10<sup>-8</sup>) differentially methylated regions. In the validation stage, we confirmed these changes for five type I IFN-associated genes. In addition, protein levels of both type I IFN-&#945; (P &lt; 0.0001) and &#946; (P&#160;= 0.002) were significantly elevated in the sera of systemic sclerosis patients. Moreover, significant associations between type I IFN-&#945;/&#946; protein levels with the DNA methylation status as well as the expression profiles of these IFN-associated genes were confirmed. In conclusion, the type I IFN pathway is dysfunctional at the epigenetic level in systemic sclerosis patients, indicating that hypomethylation and upregulation of type I IFN-associated genes might be critical in systemic sclerosis pathogenesis.",
  "Exploring a New Adaptive Routing Based on the Dijkstra Algorithm in Optical Networks-on-Chip.\nThe photoelectric hybrid network has been proposed to achieve the ultrahigh bandwidth, lower delay, and less power consumption for chip multiprocessor (CMP) systems. However, a large number of optical elements used in optical networks-on-chip (ONoCs) generate high transmission loss which will influence network performance severely and increase power consumption. In this paper, the Dijkstra algorithm is adopted to realize adaptive routing with minimum transmission loss of link and reduce the output power of the link transmitter in mesh-based ONoCs. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that the transmission loss of a link in optimized power control based on the Dijkstra algorithm could be maximally reduced compared with traditional power control based on the dimensional routing algorithm. Additionally, it has a greater advantage in saving the average output power of optical transmitter compared to the adaptive power control in previous studies, while the network size expands. With the aid of simulation software OPNET, the network performance simulations in an optimized network revealed that the end-to-end (ETE) latency and throughput are not vastly reduced in regard to a traditional network. Hence, the optimized power control proposed in this paper can greatly reduce the power consumption of s network without having a big impact on network performance.",
  "Molecular characterization and gene expression of synaptosome-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25) in the brain during both seaward and homeward migrations of chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta.\nIt is generally accepted that information about some of the odorants in the natal streams of anadromous Pacific salmon (Genus Oncorhynchus) is imprinted during their seaward migration, and that anadromous Pacific salmon use olfaction to identify their natal streams during the homeward migration. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the various pre-synaptic functions that are important for olfactory imprinting and memory retrieval in the salmon brain. Synaptosome-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25) mediates pre-synaptic vesicle exocytosis and regulates synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity. Despite the importance of synaptic plasticity for memorization, the expression of SNAP-25 in the salmon brain is not well understood. In this study, snap25 expression was detected in chum salmon (O. keta) brains using molecular biological techniques. Two cDNAs encoding salmon SNAP-25 were isolated and sequenced (SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b). These cDNAs encoded proteins with 204 amino acid residues, which showed marked homology with each other (97%). The protein and nucleotide sequences demonstrated a high level of homology between salmon SNAP-25s and those of other teleost species. By quantitative PCR, the expression of snap25a and snap25b was detected in all regions of the salmon brain, especially in the telencephalon. The expression levels of snap25a in the olfactory blub were higher during seaward migration than in upriver and post-upriver migrations, reflecting synaptogenesis in the olfactory nervous system, and snap25b in the telencephalon was increased during upriver period. Our results indicated that snap25s gene is involved in synaptic plasticity for olfactory imprinting and/or olfactory memory retrieval in Pacific salmon.",
  "Synthetic capacity does not predict elasmobranchs' ability to maintain trimethylamine oxide without a dietary contribution.\nTrimethylamine oxide (TMAO) is an organic osmolyte and universal protein stabilizer. Its role as a cytoprotectant is particularly important in ureosmotic elasmobranchs that accumulate high levels of urea, a macromolecular perturbant. Feeding is a key component in the turnover and maintenance of these nitrogenous compounds. However, previous studies examining TMAO regulation have been largely completed using starved individuals, when nitrogen balance is altered. Here, under fed conditions, we test the importance of dietary TMAO on long-term maintenance in three elasmobranch species with differing endogenous synthetic capacities. Smoothhounds (Mustelus canis), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), and little skates (Leucoraja erinacea) exhibited species- and tissue-specific differences in their ability to conserve TMAO when fed a low TMAO diet for 56days. Smoothhounds, a species with the capacity for endogenous production, exhibited a decrease in muscle TMAO. Spiny dogfish and little skates, species with no reported ability for synthesis, exhibited decreases in plasma and liver TMAO, respectively. Our findings are contrary to previous starvation studies demonstrating constant levels of TMAO for up to 56days in elasmobranchs. Further, the previously reported synthetic capacity of these species did not correlate with their ability to conserve TMAO and cannot be used to predict a species reliance on dietary contributions for prolonged maintenance. It is possible that all species rely to a degree on absorption of TMAO from the diet or that alternate synthetic or regulatory pathways play a larger role than previously thought.",
  "Severe COVID-19 Lung Infection in Older People and Periodontitis.\nPeriodontal bacteria dissemination into the lower respiratory tract may create favorable conditions for severe COVID-19 lung infection. Once lung tissues are colonized, cells that survive persistent bacterial infection can undergo permanent damage and accelerated cellular senescence. Consequently, several morphological and functional features of senescent lung cells facilitate SARS-CoV-2 replication. The higher risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, and death in older patients has generated the question whether basic aging mechanisms could be implicated in such susceptibility. Mounting evidence indicates that cellular senescence, a manifestation of aging at the cellular level, contributes to the development of age-related lung pathologies and facilitates respiratory infections. Apparently, a relationship between life-threatening COVID-19 lung infection and pre-existing periodontal disease seems improbable. However, periodontal pathogens can be inoculated during endotracheal intubation and/or aspirated into the lower respiratory tract. This review focuses on how the dissemination of periodontal bacteria into the lungs could aggravate age-related senescent cell accumulation and facilitate more efficient SARS-CoV-2 cell attachment and replication. We also consider how periodontal bacteria-induced premature senescence could influence the course of COVID-19 lung infection. Finally, we highlight the role of saliva as a reservoir for both pathogenic bacteria and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the identification of active severe periodontitis can be an opportune and valid clinical parameter for risk stratification of old patients with COVID-19.",
  "The Remarkable Metabolism of <i>Vickermania ingenoplastis</i>: Genomic Predictions.\nA recently redescribed two-flagellar trypanosomatid <i>Vickermania ingenoplastis</i> is insensitive to the classical inhibitors of respiration and thrives under anaerobic conditions. Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we analyzed its genes of the core metabolism and documented that subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes III and IV are ablated, while those of complexes I, II, and V are all present, along with an alternative oxidase. This explains the previously reported conversion of glucose to acetate and succinate by aerobic fermentation. Glycolytic pyruvate is metabolized to acetate and ethanol by pyruvate dismutation, whereby a unique type of alcohol dehydrogenase (shared only with <i>Phytomonas</i> spp.) processes an excess of reducing equivalents formed under anaerobic conditions, leading to the formation of ethanol. Succinate (formed to maintain the glycosomal redox balance) is converted to propionate by a cyclic process involving three enzymes of the mitochondrial methyl-malonyl-CoA pathway, via a cyclic process, which results in the formation of additional ATP. The unusual structure of the <i>V. ingenoplastis</i> genome and its similarity with that of <i>Phytomonas</i> spp. imply their relatedness or convergent evolution. Nevertheless, a critical difference between these two trypanosomatids is that the former has significantly increased its genome size by gene duplications, while the latter streamlined its genome.",
  "Hepatic cells derived from human skin progenitors show a typical phospholipidotic response upon exposure to amiodarone.\nPhospholipidosis is a metabolic disorder characterized by intracellular accumulation of phospholipids. It can be caused by short-term or chronic exposure to cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs). These compounds bind to phospholipids, leading to inhibition of their degradation and consequently to their accumulation in lysosomes. Drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL) is frequently at the basis of discontinuation of drug development and post-market drug withdrawal. Therefore, reliable human-relevant in vitro models must be developed to speed up the identification of compounds that are potential inducers of phospholipidosis. Here, hepatic cells derived from human skin (hSKP-HPC) were evaluated as an in vitro model for DIPL. These cells were exposed over time to amiodarone, a CAD known to induce phospholipidosis in humans. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of the typical lamellar inclusions in the cell cytoplasm. Increase of phospholipids was already detected after 24 h exposure to amiodarone, whereas a significant increase of neutral lipid vesicles could be observed after 72 h. At the transcriptional level, the modulation of genes involved in DIPL was detected. These results provide a valuable indication of the applicability of hSKP-HPC for the quick assessment of drug-induced phospholipidosis in vitro, early in the drug development process.",
  "A Molecule of the Viridomycin Family Originating from a <i>Streptomyces griseus</i>-Related Strain Has the Ability to Solubilize Rock Phosphate and to Inhibit Microbial Growth.\nSome soil-borne microorganisms are known to have the ability to solubilize insoluble rock phosphate and this process often involves the excretion of organic acids. In this issue, we describe the characterization of a novel solubilizing mechanism used by a <i>Streptomyces</i> strain related to <i>Streptomyces griseus</i> isolated from Moroccan phosphate mines. This process involves the excretion of a compound belonging to the viridomycin family that was shown to play a major role in the rock phosphate bio weathering process. We propose that the chelation of the positively charged counter ions of phosphate constitutive of rock phosphate by this molecule leads to the destabilization of the structure of rock phosphate. This would result in the solubilization of the negatively charged phosphates, making them available for plant nutrition. Furthermore, this compound was shown to inhibit growth of fungi and Gram positive bacteria, and this antibiotic activity might be due to its strong ability to chelate iron, a metallic ion indispensable for microbial growth. Considering its interesting properties, this metabolite or strains producing it could contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture acting as a novel type of slow release bio-phosphate fertilizer that has also the interesting ability to limit the growth of some common plant pathogens.",
  "Comparison of a revaprazan-loaded solid dispersion, solid SNEDDS and inclusion compound: Physicochemical characterisation and pharmacokinetics.\nThe aim of this research was to compare three strategies for enhancing the solubility of poorly water-soluble revaprazan hydrochloride: solid dispersion, solid SNEDDS and inclusion compound. The influence of polymers, surfactants and oils on the drug solubility was assessed, and via the chosen carriers, the three types of formulations were prepared utilising spray drying technique. Their physicochemical properties, solubility, dissolution and pharmacokinetics in rats were performed compared with revaprazan powder. Among the liquid SNEDDS formulations assessed, the compositions of revaprazan, peceol, Tween 80 and Labrasol (10:15:55:30, weight ratio) provided the smallest emulsion size. Moreover, this liquid SNEDDS and dextran were suspended/dissolved in distilled water, and spray-dried, producing an optimal revaprazan-loaded solid SNEDDS. The appropriate solid dispersion and inclusion compound were composed of revaprazan, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and cremophor A25 (5:1.4:5.6) and drug and hydroxyl-β-cyclodextrin (2.5:8.77), respectively. The crystalline drug was converted to an amorphous state in all formulations. In the solid dispersion, the drug was attached to the hydrophilic carrier. The solid SNEDDS and inclusion compound contained aggregate microspheres and separate microspheres, respectively. All formulations significantly increased the drug solubility, dissolution, plasma concentration and AUC compared with revaprazan powder. These properties were ranked in the order solid dispersion ≥ solid SNEDDS > inclusion compound. Particularly, the solid dispersion improved about 9500-fold drug solubility and 10-fold oral bioavailability. Thus, the improved properties were considerably dependent upon these techniques, although all of the techniques employed similar mechanisms. Among the strategies checked, the solid dispersion system would be recommended as an oral revaprazan-loaded pharmaceutical product.",
  "A vicious interplay between genetic and environmental insults in the etiology of blood cancers.\nOver the years, the etiology of cancer has been attributed alternatively to genetic and environmental insults. According to the genetic hypothesis, cancer cells arise from the acquisition of mutations that dysregulate the intrinsic mechanisms controlling normal cell growth and survival. In contrast, the environmental hypothesis holds that cancer can be caused by multiple extrinsic challenges that alter normal tissue homeostasis, but may not necessarily involve mutations. It is, however, quite possible that these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. According to this third hypothesis, environmental challenges, by mechanisms still poorly understood, may act by imposing a selection pressure that confers a proliferative advantage on cells carrying specific driver mutations, leading to disease initiation. The authors of a brief report published in this journal (Exp Hematol. 2017;56:1-6) tested this third hypothesis experimentally and provide new evidence that chronic inflammation, by increasing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, may positively select malignant hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) carrying loss-of-function TET2 mutations that switch the TNF-α signaling responses to activate proliferation rather than inducing quiescence. Furthermore, these mutations skew hematopoietic differentiation toward the myelomonocytic lineage and the output of macrophages producing TNF-α constitutively, promoting further environment-independent expansion of the malignant HSCs. These findings support a model in which the formation of a malignant population is triggered by a vicious interplay between genetic (TET2 mutations) and environmental (inflammation) insults, suggesting the need for strategies that target both the malignant cells and their environment.",
  "Exploring the neural correlates of lexical stress perception in english among Chinese-English bilingual children with autism spectrum disorder: An ERP study.\nPrevious studies found that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were less sensitive to the variations of lexical stress in their native language than typically developing controls. However, no study has been conducted to explore the perception of lexical stress in the second language among individuals with ASD. Using ERPs (event-related potentials) measurement with an oddball paradigm, the current study examined and compared the neural responses by Chinese-English bilingual children with ASD and typically developing controls in the processing of English lexical stress. The results showed that when compared with typically developing controls, children with ASD manifested reduced MMN (mismatch negativity) amplitude at the left temporal-parietal and parietal sites, indicating that they were less sensitive to lexical stress. However, a more negative MMN response was found for ASD group than for typically developing group at the right central-parietal, temporal-parietal, and temporal sites. In addition, the right hemisphere was more activated than the left hemisphere for ASD group, which might be derived from the reversed asymmetry of brain activation for individuals with ASD when processing language-related stimuli.",
  "Effects of Exercise on the Skin Epithelial Barrier of Young Elite Athletes-Swimming Comparatively to Non-Water Sports Training Session.\nThe benefits of swimming have been extensively assessed. However, swimming pools contain chlorine and other irritating chemicals that may induce contact dermatitis. To evaluate the effect of a swimming training session on transepidermal water loss (TWEL) in swimmers compared to football players, elite swimmers and football players were invited to participate (58 athletes) in the study, where TEWL was measured before, immediately after, and 30 min after a 2 h training session. The probe was held on the dorsum of the hand, volar forearm, and on the antecubital flexure for 1 min. The volar forearm, antecubital flexure, and hand dorsum showed a significant increase in TEWL in swimmers in both measurements after training compared to baseline (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In football players, an increase in TEWL was observed on the hands' dorsum between baseline and after training measurements. The variations on TEWL levels before and immediately after the training session were higher among swimmers on the volar forearm (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and antecubital flexure (<i>p</i> = 0.019). Our findings support the effect of the training environment-swimming pool versus outdoor sports-on the skin barrier function, with an increase of transepidermal water loss immediately after exercise. Exposure to a swimming pool environment in a 2 h training session may lead to changes in skin barrier function.",
  "The Taming of Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2-Related Factor-2 (Nrf2) Deglycation by Fructosamine-3-Kinase (FN3K)-Inhibitors-A Novel Strategy to Combat Cancers.\nGlycated stress is mediated by the advanced glycation end products (AGE) and the binding of AGEs to the receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGEs) in cancer cells. RAGEs are involved in mediating tumorigenesis of multiple cancers through the modulation of several downstream signaling cascades. Glycated stress modulates various signaling pathways that include p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, etc., which further foster the uncontrolled proliferation, growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, drug resistance, and evasion of apoptosis in several cancers. In this review, a balanced overview on the role of glycation and deglycation in modulating several signaling cascades that are involved in the progression of cancers was discussed. Further, we have highlighted the functional role of deglycating enzyme fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) on Nrf2-driven cancers. The activity of FN3K is attributed to its ability to deglycate Nrf2, a master regulator of oxidative stress in cells. FN3K is a unique protein that mediates deglycation by phosphorylating basic amino acids lysine and arginine in various proteins such as Nrf2. Deglycated Nrf2 is stable and binds to small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (sMAF) proteins, thereby activating cellular antioxidant mechanisms to protect cells from oxidative stress. This cellular protection offered by Nrf2 activation, in one way, prevents the transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell; however, in the other way, it helps a cancer cell not only to survive under hypoxic conditions but also, to stay protected from various chemo- and radio-therapeutic treatments. Therefore, the activation of Nrf2 is similar to a double-edged sword and, if not controlled properly, can lead to the development of many solid tumors. Hence, there is a need to develop novel small molecule modulators/phytochemicals that can regulate FN3K activity, thereby maintaining Nrf2 in a controlled activation state.",
  "Species diversity in the marine microturbellarian Astrotorhynchus bifidus sensu lato (Platyhelminthes: Rhabdocoela) from the Northeast Pacific Ocean.\nIncreasing evidence suggests that many widespread species of meiofauna are in fact regional complexes of (pseudo-)cryptic species. This knowledge has challenged the 'Everything is Everywhere' hypothesis and also partly explains the meiofauna paradox of widespread nominal species with limited dispersal abilities. Here, we investigated species diversity within the marine microturbellarian Astrotorhynchus bifidus sensu lato in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. We used a multiple-evidence approach combining multi-gene (18S, 28S, COI) phylogenetic analyses, several single-gene and multi-gene species delimitation methods, haplotype networks and conventional taxonomy to designate Primary Species Hypotheses (PSHs). This included the development of rhabdocoel-specific COI barcode primers, which also have the potential to aid in species identification and delimitation in other rhabdocoels. Secondary Species Hypotheses (SSHs) corresponding to morphospecies and pseudo-cryptic species were then proposed based on the minimum consensus of different PSHs. Our results showed that (a) there are at least five species in the A. bifidus complex in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, four of which can be diagnosed based on stylet morphology, (b) the A. bifidus complex is a mixture of sympatric and allopatric species with regional and/or subglobal distributions, (c) sympatry occurs on local (sample sites), regional (Northeastern Pacific) and subglobal (Northern Atlantic, Arctic, Northeastern Pacific) scales. Mechanisms for this co-occurrence are still poorly understood, but we hypothesize they could include habitat differentiation (spatial and/or seasonal) and life history characteristics such as sexual selection and dispersal abilities. Our results also suggest the need for improved sampling and exploration of molecular markers to accurately map gene flow and broaden our understanding of species diversity and distribution of microturbellarians in particular and meiofauna in general.",
  "Cortical slow wave activity correlates with striatal synaptic strength in normal but not in Parkinsonian rats.\nUrethane-induced cortical slow wave activity (SWA) spreads into the basal ganglia in dopamine (DA)-depleted rat models of Parkinson's disease (PD). During physiological sleep, SWA is powerfully expressed at the beginning of night and progressively reduced during sleep-time reflecting the sleep need. However, its underlying slow oscillations may contribute directly to modulate cortical plasticity. In order to determine the impact of the SWA on synaptic strength and its interplay with DA, we simultaneously recorded the electrocorticogram (ECoG) and the corticocortical- and corticostriatal-evoked potentials (CC-EPs, CS-EPs) during eight hours of robust urethane-induced SWA in both normal and PD animals. A subgroup of PD rats was assessed with repetitive apomorphine (APO) administrations. Normal animals showed a progressive reduction of SWA power during urethane-induced SWA. Compared to normal animals, PD animals showed lower SWA power at the start of anesthesia without a significant reduction over time. Accordingly, synaptic strength measured by CC- and CS-EP amplitudes decreased in normal but not in Parkinsonian rats. The PD animals treated with APO showed a CS-EP amplitude reduction comparable to normal animals. Interestingly, SWA power directly correlated with CS-EP amplitude in normal animals. These data support the hypothesis that cortical SWA is directly associated with the regulation of synaptic efficacy in which DA exerts a crucial role.",
  "Effects of non-contingent cocaine on 3alpha-androstanediol. I. Disruption of male sexual behavior.\nOne of the hallmarks of drug abuse is a reduction in the salience of, and motivation for, natural rewards, such as mating. The effects of psychostimulants on male sexual interest and performance are conflicting; use of psychostimulants can produce increases in risky sexual behaviors but have detrimental effects on sexual ability. We hypothesize that these conflicting effects on sexual behavior are due to interactions between cocaine and androgens, such as testosterone and its neuroactive metabolite, 3α-androstanediol (3α-diol). Male rats were administered saline or cocaine (5, 10, or 20mg/kg, i.p.). Motor behavior was observed in the first 30min following drug-administration, and then sexual responding was assessed for 15min. Levels of androgens (testosterone, 3ɑ-diol, and testosterone's aromatized metabolite, estradiol) were measured in circulation and brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus/striatum (hypo/str), and midbrain). Cocaine had no effect on measures of sexual interest (i.e. anogenital investigation). However, cocaine had substantial effects on consummatory sexual behaviors, such as the latency to mount/intromit and the number of sexual contacts. Frontal cortex and hypo/str 3α-diol levels were strongly correlated with consummatory behaviors in saline administered rats; however, this relationship was disrupted by cocaine at all dosages, concomitant with impaired sexual behaviors. Additionally, there was a shift in metabolism at low dosages of cocaine to push testosterone metabolism in the midbrain towards 3α-diol. On the contrary, moderate and high dosages of cocaine shifted testosterone metabolism towards estradiol. These data demonstrate that the association between cortical and hypo/str 3α-diol levels and sexual behavior of male rats is disrupted by non-contingent cocaine and that there may be dose-dependent effects of acute cocaine on androgen metabolism.",
  "Effects of Sodium Silicate Complex against Hemorrhagic Activities Induced by <i>Protobothrops mucrosquamatus</i> Venom.\n <i>Protobothrops mucrosquamatus</i> poses a serious medical threat to humans in Southern and Southeastern Asia. Hemorrhage is one of the conspicuous toxicities related to the pathology of <i>P. mucrosquamatus</i> envenoming. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies showed that a silica-derived reagent, sodium silicate complex (SSC), was able to neutralize hemorrhagic and proteolytic activities induced by pit viper venoms, including <i>Crotalus atrox</i>, <i>Agkistrodon</i><i>contortrix contortrix</i> and <i>Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma</i>. In this study, we validated that SSC could neutralize enzymatic and toxic effects caused by the venom of <i>P. mucrosquamatus</i>. We found that SSC inhibited the hemolytic and proteolytic activities induced by <i>P. mucrosquamatus</i> venom in vitro. In addition, we demonstrated that SSC could block intradermal hemorrhage caused by <i>P. mucrosquamatus</i> venom in a mouse model. Finally, SSC could neutralize lethal effects of <i>P. mucrosquamatus</i> venom in the mice. Therefore, SSC is a candidate for further development as a potential onsite first-aid treatment for <i>P. mucrosquamatus</i> envenoming.",
  "Social Inclusion and Physical Activity in Ciclovía Recreativa Programs in Latin America.\nCiclov&#237;a Recreativa is a program in which streets are closed off to automobiles so that people have a safe and inclusive space for recreation and for being physically active. The study aims were: (1) to compare participant's spatial trajectories in four Ciclov&#237;a Recreativa programs in Latin America (Bogot&#225;, Mexico City, Santiago de Cali, and Santiago de Chile) according to socioeconomic characteristics and urban segregation of these cities; and (2) to assess the relationship between participants' physical activity (PA) levels and sociodemographic characteristics. We harmonized data of cross-sectional studies including 3282 adults collected between 2015 and 2019. We found the highest mobility for recreation in Bogot&#225;, followed closely by Santiago de Cali. In these two cities, the maximum SES (socioeconomic status) percentile differences between the neighborhood of origin and the neighborhoods visited as part of the Ciclov&#237;a use were 33.58 (<i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.001) and 30.38 (<i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.001), respectively, indicating that in these two cities, participants were more likely to visit higher or lower SES neighborhoods than their average SES-of-neighborhood origin. By contrast, participants from Mexico City and Santiago de Chile were more likely to stay in geographic units similar to their average SES-of-origin, having lower overall mobility during leisure time: maximum SES percentile difference 1.55 (<i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.001) and -0.91 (<i>p</i>-value 0.001), respectively. PA levels of participants did not differ by sex or SES. Our results suggest that Ciclov&#237;a can be a socially inclusive program in highly unequal and segregated urban environments, which provides a space for PA whilefacilitat physical proximity, exposure to new communities and environments, and interactions between different socioeconomic groups.",
  "The lateral habenula interacts with the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis response upon stressful cognitive demand in rats.\nThe lateral habenula (LHb) is involved in emotional and cognitive behaviors. Recently, we have shown in rats that blockade of excitatory inputs to the LHb not only induced deficits of memory retrieval in the water maze, but also altered swim strategies (i.e., induced excessive thigmotaxis). The latter observation, although consistent with the occurrence of memory deficits, could also possibly be the consequence of an excessive level of stress, further suggesting a role for the LHb in the stress response in our behavioral paradigm. To test this hypothesis we performed in rats intra-LHb infusion of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 267 ng/side in 0.3 μL), or vehicle, and assessed the responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis to environmental stressful or non-stressful situations. We have measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentrations at different time points before and following intra-LHb infusion of CNQX - or of the same volume of vehicle - in three conditions: during the probe test of a water maze experiment; in an anxiety test, the elevated plus maze; and in a home cage condition. Whereas there were no differences in the home cage condition and in the elevated plus maze, in the water maze experiment we observed that CNQX-treated rats presented, along with memory deficits, a higher level of blood CORT than vehicle-treated rats. These results suggest that perturbations of the modulation of the HPA axis are consecutive to the alteration of LHb function, whether it is the result of a defective direct control of the LHb over the HPA axis, or the consequence of memory deficits.",
  "Hydrosalpinx Sclerotherapy Before In Vitro Fertilization: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\nThe presence of a hydrosalpinx has been shown to impair the outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. This outcome can be improved by removing the hydrosalpinx; however, there are some concerns regarding its feasibility and safety, especially in women with previous surgeries and dense adhesions. The purpose of our meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of hydrosalpinx aspiration with or without sclerotherapy on the risk of recurrence and the IVF outcome compared with salpingectomy or no intervention. We performed an electronic-based search using PubMed, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Our main outcome measures were the recurrence rate, fertility outcome, and adverse events. Ten studies were included in our review. The overall recurrence rates of hydrosalpinx aspiration with or without sclerotherapy were 21.7% to 30.5% and 21.8% to 32.5%, respectively. There was no difference in the clinical pregnancy or miscarriage rate between hydrosalpinx sclerotherapy and salpingectomy. When compared with salpingectomy, hydrosalpinx aspiration only was associated with a significantly lower clinical pregnancy rate and higher miscarriage rate. Compared with no intervention, hydrosalpinx aspiration resulted in significantly higher clinical pregnancies rates but a similar miscarriage rate. We conclude that hydrosalpinx sclerotherapy before IVF improves the fertility outcome and can be used as an alternative to salpingectomy.",
  "Nanodesign of new self-assembling core-shell gellan-transfersomes loading baicalin and in vivo evaluation of repair response in skin.\nGellan nanohydrogel and phospholipid vesicles were combined to incorporate baicalin in new self-assembling core-shell gellan-transfersomes obtained by an easy, scalable method. The vesicles were small in size (~107 nm) and monodispersed (P.I. ≤ 0.24), forming a viscous system (~24 mPa/s) as compared to transfersomes (~1.6 mPa/s), as confirmed by rheological studies. Gellan was anchored to the bilayer domains through cholesterol, and the polymer chains were distributed onto the outer surface of the bilayer, thus forming a core-shell structure, as suggested by SAXS analyses. The optimal carrier ability of core-shell gellan-transfersomes was established by the high deposition of baicalin in the skin (~11% in the whole skin), especially in the deeper tissue (~8% in the dermis). Moreover, their ability to improve baicalin efficacy in anti-inflammatory and skin repair tests was confirmed in vivo in mice, providing the complete skin restoration and inhibiting all the studied inflammatory markers.",
  "Influence of natural and synthetic vitamin C (ascorbic acid) on primary and secondary metabolites and associated metabolism in quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) plants under water deficit regimes.\nPhytoextracts are being widely used these days as a source of bioactive compounds for mitigating the harmful effects of abiotic stresses including drought stress. In this study, it was assessed how far foliar applied pure synthetic ascorbic acid (AsA) or natural sweet orange juice (OJ) enriched with AsA could mitigate the drought stress induced adverse effects on growth and some key metabolic processes in quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.; cultivar V<sub>9</sub>) plants. Two weeks old quinoa seedlings were subjected to varying irrigation regimes as control [100% field capacity (FC)] and drought stress (60% FC, 40% FC and 20% FC). After one month of water deficit treatments, various levels of ascorbic acid (150&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>-1</sup> AsA or 25% OJ) besides control [distilled water (DW) and no spray (NS)] were applied as a foliar spray. After 15 days of AsA application, different physio-biochemical attributes were measured. The results showed that water deficit markedly decreased plant growth, relative water content (RWC), photosynthetic rate, total carotenoids (CAR) and total flavonoids, while it increased relative membrane permeability (RMP), intrinsic AsA content, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), malondialdehyde (MDA), glycinebetaine (GB), total phenolics, total soluble proteins (TSP), total free amino acids, activities of key antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD)], total soluble sugars (TSS), reducing (RS) and non-reducing sugars (NRS). Most obvious results of most of these parameters were observed at 40% and 20% FC. Foliar-applied pure 150&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>-1</sup> AsA and 25% OJ were found to be very effective in improving plant growth, RMP, photosynthetic rate, CAR, proline, AsA, MDA, GB, TSP, free amino acids, SOD, POD, TSS, RS, NRS and total flavonoids. It was noticed that 25% OJ enriched with AsA and other essential nutrients and biomolecules was as efficient as 150&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>-1</sup> AsA in reducing the adverse effects of drought stress on quinoa plants. So, it was concluded that OJ, a cheaper source of vitamin C, can be used as a mitigating agent for improving drought tolerance in plants under drought-prone environments.",
  "Nitric oxide promotes light-initiated seed germination by repressing PIF1 expression and stabilizing HFR1.\nSeed germination is a crucial stage in the life cycle of plants and is tightly controlled by internal and external signals. Phytochrome photoreceptors perceive light stimulation to promote seed germination. Previous studies have shown that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTION FACTOR 1 (PIF1) is a negative regulatory factor and represses seed germination, while LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED (HFR1) sequesters PIF1 by forming a heterodimer to relieve the inhibitory effect of seed germination during the initial phase. Nitric oxide (NO) has been reported to break seed dormancy, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we report that NO signal enhances phytochrome B (PHYB)-dependent seed germination, and PHYB perceives red light stimulation to activate NR activity and NO accumulation. NO signal not only downregulates the transcription of PIF1, but also stabilize HFR1 proteins to intensify the interaction of the HFR1-PIF1 heterodimer, and compensate for the inhibitory effect of PIF1 on its target genes associated with hormone metabolism and cell wall loosening, consequently initiating seed germination. Thus, our results reveal a new mechanism for NO signals in modulating PHYB-mediated seed germination by repressing PIF1 expression at the transcriptional level as well as preventing PIF1 activity by stabilizing HFR1 protein.",
  "Application of silica coated magnetite nanoparticles modified with Cu(I)-neocuproine as nanosorbent to simultaneous separation-preconcentration of trace amounts of nitrate and nitrite.\nA novel, inexpensive and sensitive type of magnetic nanosorbent based on the functionalized silica-coated Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles was prepared and used for the adsorption of trace amounts of nitrite and nitrate ions. The work is based on selective ion-pairing complex formation of nitrate and nitrite with Cu(I)-neocuproine which are covalently bounded on nanoparticles. Nitrite was determined according to its reaction with barbituric acid to give violuric acid and determination of nitrate was based on its reduction to nitrite in the presence of Zn/NaCl. After formation of violuric acid, the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 310&#8239;nm. The quantitative recoveries were obtained at pH 5.5 for the analytes. Under optimum conditions, the limits of detection in the original solutions were 0.49&#8239;&#956;g L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.40&#8239;&#956;g&#8239;L<sup>-1</sup> for nitrate and nitrite, respectively. The linearity ranges were found to be 1.5 to 2.8&#8239;&#215;&#8239;10<sup>3</sup>&#8239;&#956;g&#8239;L<sup>-1</sup>(NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and 1.2 to 1.9&#8239;&#215;&#8239;10<sup>3</sup>&#8239;&#956;g&#8239;L<sup>-1</sup> (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>). The preconcentration factor was 120 for nitrate and 150 for nitrite. This method has been successfully applied to the determination of trace amounts of nitrite and nitrate in various water and food samples and also accuracy was confirmed by the analysis of the spiked recovery test.",
  "Augmented reality for personalized nanomedicines.\nAs our understanding of onset and progress of diseases at the genetic and molecular level rapidly progresses, the potential of advanced technologies, such as 3D-printing, Socially-Assistive Robots (SARs) or augmented reality (AR), that are applied to personalized nanomedicines (PNMs) to alleviate pathological conditions, has become more prominent. Among advanced technologies, AR in particular has the greatest potential to address those challenges and facilitate the translation of PNMs into formidable clinical application of personalized therapy. As AR is about to adapt additional new methods, such as speech, voice recognition, eye tracing and motion tracking, to enable interaction with host response or biological systems in 3-D space, a combination of multiple approaches to accommodate varying environmental conditions, such as public noise and atmosphere brightness, will be explored to improve its therapeutic outcomes in clinical applications. For instance, AR glasses still being developed by Facebook or Microsoft will serve as new platform that can provide people with the health information they are interested in or various measures through which they can interact with medical services. This review has addressed the current progress and impact of AR on PNMs and its application to the biomedical field. Special emphasis is placed on the application of AR based PNMs to the treatment strategies against senior care, drug addiction and medication adherence.",
  "Vasodilator and hypotensive effects of the spider peptide Lycosin-I in vitro and in vivo.\nLycosin-I, a spider peptide isolated from the venom of the spider Lycosa singoriensis, has anti-bacteria and anti-cancer properties in organisms. However, cardiovascular effects of Lycosin-I have not been studied. In this study, we investigated for the first time the vasodilator and hypotensive effects of Lycosin-I and the possible mechanisms, in order to develop a promising treatment for hypertension-related diseases. For in vitro experiments, thoracic aortas were isolated, and divided into two groups, endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded aortic rings. Lycosin-I induced a remarkable dose-dependent relaxation in endothelium-intact aortic rings pre-treated with phenylephrine (p < 0.05), while it showed no obvious vasodilator effects in endothelium-denuded aortic rings (p > 0.05). The vasodilator effects of Lycosin-I were significantly weakened by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NAME (p < 0.001) and a selective inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO)-sensitive soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), ODQ (p < 0.05), respectively. The levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and the NO production were significantly higher in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells pre-cultured with Lycosin-I than the control (p < 0.001), determined via western blot analysis and ozone-chemiluminescence technology. For in vivo experiments, arterial and venous catheters were inserted for mean arterial pressure (MAP) recording and drug administration in anaesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats. Lycosin-I caused a transient drop of MAP 2 min after the administration compared with the control (p < 0.001). In conclusion, Lycosin-I has the potential to be an anti-hypertensive drug by endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, in which eNOS and NO-sensitive sGC are two main involved factors.",
  "3D spatially-adaptive canonical correlation analysis: Local and global methods.\nLocal spatially-adaptive canonical correlation analysis (local CCA) with spatial constraints has been introduced to fMRI multivariate analysis for improved modeling of activation patterns. However, current algorithms require complicated spatial constraints that have only been applied to 2D local neighborhoods because the computational time would be exponentially increased if the same method is applied to 3D spatial neighborhoods. In this study, an efficient and accurate line search sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm has been developed to efficiently solve the 3D local CCA problem with spatial constraints. In addition, a spatially-adaptive kernel CCA (KCCA) method is proposed to increase accuracy of fMRI activation maps. With oriented 3D spatial filters anisotropic shapes can be estimated during the KCCA analysis of fMRI time courses. These filters are orientation-adaptive leading to rotational invariance to better match arbitrary oriented fMRI activation patterns, resulting in improved sensitivity of activation detection while significantly reducing spatial blurring artifacts. The kernel method in its basic form does not require any spatial constraints and analyzes the whole-brain fMRI time series to construct an activation map. Finally, we have developed a penalized kernel CCA model that involves spatial low-pass filter constraints to increase the specificity of the method. The kernel CCA methods are compared with the standard univariate method and with two different local CCA methods that were solved by the SQP algorithm. Results show that SQP is the most efficient algorithm to solve the local constrained CCA problem, and the proposed kernel CCA methods outperformed univariate and local CCA methods in detecting activations for both simulated and real fMRI episodic memory data.",
  "Might Fibroblasts from Patients with Alzheimer's Disease Reflect the Brain Pathology? A Focus on the Increased Phosphorylation of Amyloid Precursor Protein Tyr<sub>682</sub> Residue.\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no cure and no effective diagnostic criteria. The greatest challenge in effectively treating AD is identifying biomarkers specific for each patient when neurodegenerative processes have not yet begun, an outcome that would allow the design of a personalised therapeutic approach for each patient and the monitoring of the therapeutic response during the treatment. We found that the excessive phosphorylation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) Tyr<sub>682</sub> residue on the APP <sub>682</sub>YENPTY<sub>687</sub> motif precedes amyloid &#946; accumulation and leads to neuronal degeneration in AD neurons. We proved that Fyn tyrosine kinase elicits APP phosphorylation on Tyr<sub>682</sub> residue, and we reported increased levels of APP Tyr<sub>682</sub> and Fyn overactivation in AD neurons. Here, we want to contemplate the possibility of using fibroblasts as tools to assess APP Tyr<sub>682</sub> phosphorylation in AD patients, thus making the changes in APP Tyr<sub>682</sub> phosphorylation levels a potential diagnostic strategy to detect early pathological alterations present in the peripheral cells of AD patients' AD brains.",
  "Transcriptomic responses of the freshwater snail (Parafossarulus striatulus) following dietary exposure to cyanobacteria.\nFreshwater snails are promising bioindicators that can be used in ecotoxicological testing and ecological risk assessments. To screen molecular responses following mollusk exposure to algal blooms, whole transcriptome sequencing was performed with the freshwater snail (Parafossarulus striatulus) fed with blue algae (Microcystis aeruginosa). A total of 86,848 unigenes were assembled, and 10,413 unigenes were annotated in the TrEMBL, Pfam, KEGG, and SwissProt databases. In snails fed with both green and blue algae, a total of 276 differentially expressed unigenes were identified, though there were limited differences in snails fed with only green algae. In addition, ten randomly selected differentially expressed unigenes were analyzed in snails collected from Taihu Lake, China. The expression of four unigenes exhibited a trend consistent with that observed in transcriptome profiling of laboratory snails. The results of this study provide an invaluable resource for enhancing our understanding of ecotoxicology following the occurrence of algal blooms in lakes.",
  "Optimizing accuracy of protocols for measuring dry matter and nutrient yield of forage crops.\nFarmers around the world must precisely manage nutrients applied to and removed from crop fields to maintain production and without causing nutrient pollution. This study is the first to quantify the baseline accuracy of current industry measurement protocols and achievable accuracy from intensifying protocols for measuring dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and phosphorus (P) yields from forage crops harvested for silage. The 'true' DM and nutrient yields of three fields each of corn, sorghum, and small grain were intensively measured by weighing and sampling every truckload of harvested forage. Simulations quantified the accuracy of practical sampling protocols by repeatedly subsampling the complete dataset for each field to measure average truckload weight and average DM and nutrient concentrations. Then uncertainty was propagated to DM, N, P, and K yield calculations using standard error equations. Yields measured using current industry protocols diverged from the true yields of some fields by more than ±40%, emphasizing the need for improved protocols. This study shows that improving average DM and nutrient concentration measurements is unlikely to improve accuracy of yield measurements if average load weight is not precisely measured. Accuracy did not come within 27% of true yields without weighing all truckloads on some fields even when DM and nutrient concentration measurements were perfectly accurate. Once all truckloads were weighed, the timing of forage sample collection to measure average DM concentration had the greatest impact on accuracy; precision improved by an average of 6.2% when >3 samples were evenly spaced throughout the harvest compared to the same number of consecutive samples. All crop fields are affected by within field variation in growing conditions that results in heterogeneity in DM and nutrient yield. Globally, this study provides foundational methodology to quantitatively evaluate and improve yield measurement protocols that ultimately support sustainable crop production.",
  "Energy-Aware System Design for Autonomous Wireless Sensor Nodes: A Comprehensive Review.\nNowadays, wireless sensor networks are becoming increasingly important in several sectors including industry, transportation, environment and medicine. This trend is reinforced by the spread of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in almost all sectors. Autonomous energy supply is thereby an essential aspect as it decides the flexible positioning and easy maintenance, which are decisive for the acceptance of this technology, its wide use and sustainability. Significant improvements made in the last years have shown interesting possibilities for realizing energy-aware wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) by designing manifold and highly efficient energy converters and reducing energy consumption of hardware, software and communication protocols. Using only a few of these techniques or focusing on only one aspect is not sufficient to realize practicable and market relevant solutions. This paper therefore provides a comprehensive review on system design for battery-free and energy-aware WSN, making use of ambient energy or wireless energy transmission. It addresses energy supply strategies and gives a deep insight in energy management methods as well as possibilities for energy saving on node and network level. The aim therefore is to provide deep insight into system design and increase awareness of suitable techniques for realizing battery-free and energy-aware wireless sensor nodes.",
  "Cd-doped Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanostructures modified glassy carbon electrode for efficient detection of melamine by electrochemical approach.\nCadmium doped antimony oxide (Cd-doped Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) nanostructures (CAO-NSs) were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method in alkaline phase at low temperature to detect the melamine from aqueous solution. The calcined CAO-NSs were characterized systematically by FE-SEM, EDS, UV/Vis., FTIR spectroscopy, powder XRD, and XPS techniques. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with the CAO-NSs and sensing performance towards the selective melamine was explored by the electrochemical approach in phosphate buffer solution. The melamine undergoes a reduction reaction in the presence of CAO-NSs/GCE in PBS. The CAO-NSs/GCE attained the higher sensitivity (3.153&#956;A&#956;M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-2</sup>) for a wide ranges of concentration (LDR: 0.05nM-0.5mM), an ultra-low limit of detection (LOD: 14.0 &#177; 0.05p.M.; S/N = 3), long-term stability, excellent repeatability, and reproducibility. This method might represent an efficient way of sensitive sensor development for the toxic melamine and their derivatives for the safety of biomedical and health care fields in broad scales.",
  "Power-over-Fiber LPIT for Voltage and Current Measurements in the Medium Voltage Distribution Networks.\nIn this work, we present the design, laboratory tests, and the field trial results of a power-over-fiber (PoF) low power instrument transformer (LPIT) for voltage and current measurements in the medium voltage distribution networks. The new proposed design of this power-over-fiber LPIT aims to overcome the drawbacks presented by the previous technologies, such as the continuous operation (measuring and data transmission) for a wide current range conducted in the medium voltage transmission lines, damage due to lightning strikes, accuracy dependency on vibration, position and temperatures. The LPIT attends the accuracy criteria of IEC 61869-10 and IEC 61869-11 in terms of current and voltage accuracy and it attends the practical criteria adopted by Utilities companies including voltage measurements without removing the coating of the covered conductors. The PoF based LPIT was developed to be applied at 11.9 kV, 13.8 kV, and 23.0 kV phase-to-phase nominal voltages, and in two current ranges 1.25-30 A and 37.5-900 A. The digital data transmission of current, voltage, and temperature from the sensing unit to the processing unit uses a special synchronism technique and it is performed by two 62.5 µm multimode fibers in 850 nm. The optical powering in 976 nm is also performed by one 62.5 µm multimode fiber from the processing unit to the sensor unit. We presented all details of the sensor design and its laboratory characterization in terms of accuracy and temperature correction. We also presented the results of field tests of the sensor made in two different conditions: in a standard distribution network and an experimental hybrid fiber/power distribution network. We believe that these studies aim to incorporate optical fiber and devices, digital technologies, communications systems in electrical systems driving their evolution.",
  "Crosstalk between Nrf2 and YAP contributes to maintaining the antioxidant potential and chemoresistance in bladder cancer.\nRedox adaptation plays an important role in cancer cells drug resistance. The antioxidant response is principally mediated by the transcription factor Nrf2, that induces the transcriptional activation of several genes involved in GSH synthesis, chemoresistance, and cytoprotection. YAP is emerging as a key mediator of chemoresistance in a variety of cancers, but its role in controlling the antioxidant status of the cells is yet elusive. Here, we show that impairing YAP protein expression reduced GSH content and Nrf2 protein and mRNA expression in bladder cancer cells. Moreover, in YAP knocked down cells the expression of FOXM1, a transcription factor involved in Nrf2 transcription, was down-regulated and the silencing of FOXM1 reduced Nrf2 expression. On the other hand, the silencing of Nrf2, as well as the depletion of GSH by BSO treatment, inhibited YAP expression, suggesting that cross-talk exists between YAP and Nrf2 proteins. Importantly, we found that silencing either YAP or Nrf2 enhanced sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to cytotoxic agents and reduced their migration. Furthermore, the inhibition of both YAP and Nrf2 expressions significantly increased cytotoxic drug sensitivity and synergistically reduced the migration of chemoresistant bladder cancer cells. These findings provide a rationale for targeting these transcriptional regulators in patients with chemoresistant bladder cancer, expressing high YAP and bearing a proficient antioxidant system.",
  "Temperature-Controlled Crystal Size of Wide Band Gap Nickel Oxide and Its Application in Electrochromism.\nNickel oxide (NiO) is a wide band gap semiconductor material that is used as an electrochromic layer or an ion storage layer in electrochromic devices. In this work, the effect of annealing temperature on sol-gel NiO films was investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed that the formation of NiO via decomposition of the precursor nickel acetate occurred at about 300 °C. Meanwhile, an increase in roughness was observed by Atomic force microscope (AFM), and precipitation of a large number of crystallites was observed at 500 °C. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) showed that the NiO film obtained at such a temperature showed a degree of crystallinity. The film crystallinity and crystallite size also increased with increasing annealing temperature. An ultraviolet spectrophotometer was used to investigate the optical band gap of the colored NiO films, and it was found that the band gap increased from 3.65 eV to 3.74 eV with the increase in annealing temperature. An electrochromic test further showed that optical modulation density and coloring efficiency decreased with the increase in crystallite size. The electrochromic reaction of the nickel oxide film is more likely to occur at the crystal interface and is closely related to the change of the optical band gap. An NiO film with smaller crystallite size is more conducive to ion implantation and the films treated at 300 °C exhibit optimum electrochromic behavior.",
  "Inhibition of the Lipid Droplet-Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α Axis Suppresses Cancer Stem Cell Properties.\nCancer stem cells (CSCs), having both self-renewal and tumorigenic capacity, utilize an energy metabolism system different from that of non-CSCs. Lipid droplets (LDs) are organelles that store neutral lipids, including triacylglycerol. Previous studies demonstrated that LDs are formed and store lipids as an energy source in some CSCs. LDs play central roles not only in lipid storage, but also as a source of endogenous lipid ligands, which are involved in numerous signaling pathways, including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. However, it remains unclear whether LD-derived signal transduction is involved in the maintenance of the properties of CSCs. We investigated the roles of LDs in cancer stemness using pancreatic and colorectal CSCs and isogenic non-CSCs. PPARα was activated in CSCs in which LDs accumulated, but not in non-CSCs, and pharmacological and genetic inhibition of PPARα suppressed cancer stemness. In addition, inhibition of both re-esterification and lipolysis pathways suppressed cancer stemness. Our study suggested that LD metabolic turnover accompanying PPARα activation is a promising anti-CSC therapeutic target.",
  "Effects and limitations of a nucleobase-driven backmapping procedure for nucleic acids using steered molecular dynamics.\nCoarse-grained models can be of great help to address the problem of structure prediction in nucleic acids. On one hand they can make the prediction more efficient, while on the other hand they can also help to identify the essential degrees of freedom and interactions for the description of a number of structures. With the aim to provide an all-atom representation in an explicit solvent to the predictions of our SPlit and conQueR (SPQR) coarse-grained model of RNA, we recently introduced a backmapping procedure which enforces the predicted structure into an atomistic one by means of steered molecular dynamics. These simulations minimize the ERMSD, a particular metric which deals exclusively with the relative arrangement of nucleobases, between the atomistic representation and the target structure. In this paper, we explore the effects of this approach on the resulting interaction networks and backbone conformations by applying it on a set of fragments using as a target their native structure. We find that the geometry of the target structures can be reliably recovered, with limitations in the regions with unpaired bases such as bulges. In addition, we observe that the folding pathway can also change depending on the parameters used in the definition of the ERMSD and the use of other metrics such as the RMSD.",
  "Pharmacokinetic profile of PBRM in rodents, a first selective covalent inhibitor of 17β-HSD1 for breast cancer and endometriosis treatments.\nThe development of a covalent inhibitor of 17&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17&#946;-HSD1) is a promising approach for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer and endometriosis. After reporting the steroid derivative PBRM as a first potent covalent inhibitor of 17&#946;-HSD1 without estrogenic activity, we are now interested in studying its pharmaceutical behavior. The metabolism study in a human liver microsomal preparation showed a gradual transformation of PBRM into PBRM-O, an oxidized ketonic form of PBRM at position C17. Interestingly, PBRM-O also inhibits 17&#946;-HSD1 and is not estrogenic in estrogen-sensitive T-47D cells. However, when PBRM was injected subcutaneously (sc) in mice, a very small proportion of PBRM-O was measured in a 24 h-time course experiment. A pharmacokinetic study in mice revealed suitable values for half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub>&#8239;=&#8239;3.4&#8239;h), clearance (CL&#8239;=&#8239;2088&#8239;mL/h kg), distribution volume (Vz&#8239;=&#8239;10.3&#8239;L/kg) and absolute bioavailability (F&#8239;=&#8239;65%) when PBRM was injected sc at 14.7&#8239;mg/kg. A good F value of 33% was also obtained when PBRM was given orally. A tritiated version of PBRM, <sup>3</sup>H-PBRM, was synthesized and used for an in vivo biodistribution study that showed its gradual accumulation in various mouse tissues (peak at 6&#8239;h) followed by elimination until complete disappearance after 72&#8239;h. Elimination was found to occur in feces (93%) and urine (7%) as revealed by a mass balance experiment. PBRM was also evaluated for its toxicity in mice and it was found to be very well tolerated after weekly sc administration (30-405&#8239;mg/kg for 8 weeks) or by po administration (300-900&#8239;mg/kg for 4 weeks). Overall, these experiments represent important steps in the preclinical characterization of the pharmaceutical behavior of PBRM, as well as for its translation to clinical trials.",
  "Direct Evaluation of Mixed Mode I+II Cohesive Laws of Wood by Coupling MMB Test with DIC.\nGoverning cohesive laws in mixed mode I+II loading of <i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait. are directly identified by coupling the mixed mode bending test with full-field displacements measured at the crack tip by Digital Image Correlation (DIC). A sequence of mixed mode ratios is studied. The proposed data reduction relies on: (i) the compliance-based beam method for evaluating strain energy release rate; (ii) the local measurement of displacements to compute the crack tip opening displacement; and (iii) an uncoupled approach for the reconstruction of the cohesive laws and its mode I and mode II components. Quantitative parameters are extracted from the set of cohesive laws components in function of the global phase angle. Linear functions were adjusted to reflect the observed trends and the pure modes (I and II) fracture parameters were estimated by extrapolation. Results show that the obtained assessments agree with previous experimental measurements addressing pure modes (I and II) loadings on this wood species, which reveals the appropriateness of the proposed methodology to evaluate the cohesive law under mixed mode loading and its components.",
  "Hybrid Cyber Petri net Modelling, Simulation and Analysis of Master-Slave Charging for Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks.\nWireless charging provides continuous energy for wireless sensor networks. However, it is difficult to replenish enough energy for all sensor nodes with fixed charging alone, and even more unrealistic to charge a large number of nodes within a short time via mobile charging. In order to overcome the above weaknesses, this paper firstly puts forward a Master-Slave Charging mode for the WRSN (Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Network), where fixed charging is the master mode and mobile charging is the slave mode, respectively. However, Master-Slave Charging is a typical hybrid system involving discrete event decision and continuous energy transfer. Therefore, the Hybrid Cyber Petri net system is proposed to build a visual specification with mathematical expression of Master-Slave Charging. Moreover, wireless charging in the WRSN is modeled and evaluated from the perspective of a hybrid system for the first time. Furthermore, a greedy-genetic algorithm is proposed to obtain the deployment of fixed chargers and the path planning of a mobile charger, by maximizing the actual electric quantity of the master charging problem and minimizing the mobile charger's travelling path of the slave charging problem. Finally, the simulation results confirm and verify the Hybrid Cyber Petri net model for Master-Slave Charging. It is worth noting that the proposed model in this paper is highly adaptable to various charging modes in the WRSN.",
  "NMR interaction tensors of <sup>51</sup>V and <sup>207</sup>Pb in vanadinite, Pb<sub>5</sub>(VO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl, determined from DFT calculations and single-crystal NMR measurements, using only one general rotation axis.\nOrientation-dependent NMR spectra of a single crystal of the mineral vanadinite, Pb<sub>5</sub>(VO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl, were acquired using only one rotation axis with a general orientation in the hexagonal crystal lattice (space group P6<sub>3</sub>/m). The chemical shift (CS) tensors for the <sup>207</sup>Pb on Wyckoff positions 6h and 4f, and both CS and quadrupole coupling tensor Q for <sup>51</sup>V at the positions 6h were determined by including the NMR response of symmetry-related atoms in the unit cell (and in case of <sup>207</sup>Pb&#160;at 4f, also the isotropic shift from MAS NMR spectra). This previously suggested 'single rotation method' greatly reduces the necessary amount of data acquisition and analysis. The precise orientation of the rotation axis could not be found by X-ray diffraction experiments because of the high linear absorption coefficient of vanadinite, which is chiefly due to its high lead content. The axis orientation was therefore included into the multi-parameter data fit routine. This NMR-based approach is widely applicable, and offers an alternative way of orienting single crystals. The NMR parameters derived from the tensor eigenvalues are &#948;<sub>iso</sub>=(-1729&#177;9) ppm, &#916;&#948;=(-1071&#177;5) ppm, &#951;<sub>CS</sub>=0.362&#177;0.008 for <sup>207</sup>Pb&#160;at positions 6h, and &#948;<sub>iso</sub>=(-1619&#177;2) ppm, &#916;&#948;=(-780&#177;58) ppm, &#951;<sub>CS</sub>=0.06&#177;0.08 for positions 4f. For <sup>51</sup>V, &#948;<sub>iso</sub>=(-509&#177;3) ppm, &#916;&#948;=(-37&#177;2) ppm, &#951;<sub>CS</sub>=0.78&#177;0.09, with the quadrupolar coupling described by &#967;=(2.52&#177;0.01) MHz and &#951;<sub>Q</sub>=0.047&#177;0.003. In contrast to the precisely determined tensor eigenvalues, the orientation of the eigenvectors in the crystal ab -plane of the vanadinite system could only be resolved by resorting to data obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",
  "Envelope glycoproteins sampling states 2/3 are susceptible to ADCC by sera from HIV-1-infected individuals.\nRecent analysis of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) dynamics showed that the unliganded Env trimer can potentially sample three conformations: a metastable \"closed\" conformation (State 1), an \"open\" CD4-bound conformation (State 3), and an intermediate \"partially open\" conformation (State 2). HIV-1 evolved several mechanisms to avoid \"opening\" its Env in order to evade immune responses such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which preferentially targets Envs in the CD4-bound conformation on the surface of infected cells. Here we took advantage of a well-characterized single-residue change in the gp120 trimer association domain to modify Env conformation and evaluate its impact on ADCC responses. We found that cells infected with viruses expressing Env stabilized in States 2/3 become highly susceptible to ADCC responses by sera from HIV-1-infected individuals. Our results indicate that the conformations spontaneously sampled by the Env trimer at the surface of infected cells has a significant impact on ADCC responses.",
  "Asbestos fibre burden in gallbladder: A case study.\nThe methods conventionally used to determine the burden of asbestos fibres inhaled/incorporated in lung require chemical digestion of the biological matrix before counting/characterising the inorganic fibrous phases under scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Asbestos fibres can also be present in extra-pulmonary organs, and we set out to quantify the fibres in gallbladder. Although the standardised procedure requires approximately 5&#8239;&#215;&#8239;10<sup>-1</sup>&#8239;g of wet tissue, this amount of tissue is not always available. We applied the procedure on about 9&#8239;&#215;&#8239;10<sup>-4</sup>&#8239;g of gallbladder from a patient with known environmental and workplace exposure to asbestos. The patient died of malignant pleural mesothelioma and was also affected by severe bile-tract problems. The traditional procedure of digesting tissue samples in NaClO and filtering the resulting suspension was carried out. The filter was then examined under SEM/EDS using two methods 1. following the standardised procedure to assess the fibre burden in lung by investigating only 2&#8239;mm<sup>2</sup> of the filter (660 microscopic fields), and 2. analysing all the microscopic fields in one-quarter of the filter (about 82&#8239;mm<sup>2</sup>). In parallel, histological sections (prepared in the usual way for medical diagnosis) were analysed without digestion or manipulation of the sample using variable pressure SEM/EDS. The fibre counts obtained using the two methods were of the same order of magnitude, i.e., &#8764;10<sup>5</sup> fibres/g of wet tissue. We showed that the counting of fibres in human tissue may be successfully carried out even when a limited amount of tissue is available. We also found that, when exposure to asbestos is considerable, the number of asbestos fibres accumulating in the gallbladder may be significant.",
  "Experimental Investigation of Integrated Circular Triple-Wire Pulse GMAW of Q960E High-Strength Steel for Construction Machinery.\nMulti-wire welding has received much attention in the machinery industry due to its high efficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate a novel pulse gas metal arc welding (GMAW) that has circular triple-wire electrodes. The effect of the pulse phage angle on arc stability was particularly studied. Research showed that for typical phase angles the arc stability from low to high is 180°, 0°, and 120°, and the arcs are very stable at 120°. The triple-wire welding was used to weld a 9 mm thick Q960E steel, which is typically used for the arm of construction machinery. When the welding heat input was controlled at 1.26-1.56 kJ/mm, the weld zone was dominated by acicular ferrite, and the coarse-grained zone of the heat-affected zone was a mixed structure of lath martensite and lath bainite. The tensile strength of the welded joint reached 85% of the base metal and the impact toughness was above 62 J, which can meet the requirements of construction machinery. This indicates that the triple-wire welding has great potential to achieve efficient and high-quality welding for the construction machinery.",
  "Qualitative Differences in Protection of PTP1B Activity by the Reductive Trx1 or TRP14 Enzyme Systems upon Oxidative Challenges with Polysulfides or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Together with Bicarbonate.\nProtein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) can be regulated by several redox-dependent mechanisms and control growth factor-activated receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation cascades. Reversible oxidation of PTPs is counteracted by reductive enzymes, including thioredoxin (Trx) and Trx-related protein of 14 kDa (TRP14), keeping PTPs in their reduced active states. Different modes of oxidative inactivation of PTPs concomitant with assessment of activating reduction have been little studied in direct comparative analyses. Determining PTP1B activities, we here compared the potency of inactivation by bicarbonate-assisted oxidation using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with that of polysulfide-mediated inactivation. Inactivation of pure PTP1B was about three times more efficient with polysulfides as compared to the combination of bicarbonate and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Bicarbonate alone had no effect on PTP1B, neither with nor without a combination with polysulfides, thus strengthening the notion that bicarbonate-assisted H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated inactivation of PTP1B involves formation of peroxymonocarbonate. Furthermore, PTP1B was potently protected from polysulfide-mediated inactivation by either TRP14 or Trx1, in contrast to the inactivation by bicarbonate and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Comparing reductive activation of polysulfide-inactivated PTP1B with that of bicarbonate- and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated enzyme, we found Trx1 to be more potent in reactivation than TRP14. Altogether we conclude that inactivation of PTP1B by polysulfides displays striking qualitative differences compared to that by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> together with bicarbonate, also with regard to maintenance of PTP1B activity by either Trx1 or TRP14.",
  "A Smart Biometric Identity Management Framework for Personalised IoT and Cloud Computing-Based Healthcare Services.\nThis paper proposes a novel identity management framework for Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing-based personalized healthcare systems. The proposed framework uses multimodal encrypted biometric traits to perform authentication. It employs a combination of centralized and federated identity access techniques along with biometric based continuous authentication. The framework uses a fusion of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals when performing authentication. In addition to relying on the unique identification characteristics of the users' biometric traits, the security of the framework is empowered by the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). The use of HE allows patients' data to stay encrypted when being processed or analyzed in the cloud. Thus, providing not only a fast and reliable authentication mechanism, but also closing the door to many traditional security attacks. The framework's performance was evaluated and validated using a machine learning (ML) model that tested the framework using a dataset of 25 users in seating positions. Compared to using just ECG or PPG signals, the results of using the proposed fused-based biometric framework showed that it was successful in identifying and authenticating all 25 users with 100% accuracy. Hence, offering some significant improvements to the overall security and privacy of personalized healthcare systems.",
  "Investigation of a high-pressure pressed powder pellet technique for the analysis of coal by wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy.\nUsing the proposed high-pressure pressed powder pellet technique, a coal sample was pressed into an ideal pellet without binders, which provides a solution to the poor self-binding quality of coal for the determination by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). The pellet produced by this method was more compact and smoother, which was particularly meaningful for spectrometer, where the sample is placed over the tube window. Additionally, the high-pressure sample preparation technique effectively eliminated the effect of falling powder and contamination in the Measuring chamber of the spectrometer. Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (WDXRF) was applied successfully to the determination of carbon, nitrogen and ash content in coal samples. This could provide an alternative method for the rapid analysis of carbon, nitrogen and ash content in the coal rather than the combustion method or the high-frequency infrared absorption with a slow ashing method. Furthermore, WDXRF could provide simultaneous determination of other major, minor and trace elements by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The XRF results indicated that the sensitivity, precision, and limit of detection for most components were improved when the coal sample was pressed at 1600kN compared with preparation at 400kN.",
  "Rewetting in Mediterranean reclaimed peaty soils and its potential for phyto-treatment use.\nA pilot experimental field combining rewetting of reclaimed peaty soils and water phyto-treatment was set up in the Massaciuccoli Lake basin (Tuscany, Italy) to reduce the water eutrophication and peat degradation caused by almost a century of drainage-based agricultural use. In this paper, we investigated the restoration process occurring consequently to the conversion of a drained area in a natural wetland system (NWS) (the partial top soil removal, the realization of a perimeter levee to contain the waters, the rewetting with the drainage waters coming from the of surrounding cultivated areas) and the capability of the spontaneous vegetation to catch nutrients acting as a vegetation filter. To follow the restoration process over time (2012-2016), we used a mixed approach merging phytosociological surveys with ortophotos taken by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). During the last year of observation (2016), we performed destructive sampling on the most widespread plant communities in the area (Phragmites australis and Myriophyllum aquaticum community) to quantify the biomass production and the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus. Stands of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. yielded more than Myriophyllum aquaticum (Vell.) Verdc. (4.94 kg m-2 vs 1.08 kg m-2). M. aquaticum showed higher nutrient contents (2.04% of N and 0.35% of P), however P. australis was able to take up more nutrients within the NWS because of its larger cover and productivity. In the perspective of maximizing the plant development and consequently the amount of nutrients extracted from treated waters, the authors suggest 4-5 year-long-harvesting turns, better occurring in spring-summer.",
  "Morphometric and Molecular Analyses of <i>Ostertagia leptospicularis</i> Assadov, 1953 from Ruminants: Species Diversity or Host Influence?\n\n                                    <i>Ostertagia leptospicularis</i> Assadov, 1953 was formally described in roe deer <i>Capreolus capreolus</i> and has been reported in a wide range of ruminants, including other Cervidae, as well as Bovidae. Nematode specimens derived from various host species exhibit morphological similarity; however, some differences can be observed. It is unclear if this is due to the differential reaction of one nematode species in different host species (i.e., host-induced changes) or because of distinct nematode species in these hosts (i.e., species complex). This paper focuses on specimens resembling <i>O. leptospicularis</i> f. <i>leptospicularis</i> and its closely related species (<i>Ostertagia ostertagi</i> f. <i>ostertagi</i>) collected from various hosts. Morphometric and molecular techniques were applied to assess host-induced changes in nematode morphology and to clarify its systematic classification. There was an overall effect of host species on measurements of nematodes resembling <i>O. leptospicularis</i> (both males and females), but the distinctiveness of the specimens from cattle <i>Bos taurus</i> were highlighted. The results obtained may suggest that the specimens of <i>O. leptospicularis</i> from cattle in Germany and cervids in central Europe belong to different strains. Furthermore, nematodes from the cervid strain appear to circulate within particular host species, which can be seen in the stated morphological variations.",
  "An efficient subarray average delay multiply and sum beamformer algorithm in ultrasound imaging.\nBeamformer plays an important role in medical ultrasound imaging systems. The delay multiply and sum (DMAS) beamformer achieves better performance in contrast and resolution compared with the delay and sum (DAS) beamformer, but suffers from higher computational complexity and partial energy loss. The higher computational complexity mainly arises from the multiply and geometric average operation, which needs (N<sup>2</sup>-N)/2 computations at every point, where N denotes the number of array elements. The partial energy loss, mainly due to the autocorrelation component of the echo signals, has been neglected in the DMAS beamformer. In this paper, we propose a subarray average delay multiply and sum (SA-DMAS) beamformer which is combined with subarray average technique of covariance matrix and DMAS beamformer. This will lower the computational complexity, while keeping the side lobe suppressing property of DMAS. The main idea of the proposed method is adding autocorrelation component of the echo signals to DMAS, and converting the expression in covariance matrix form. The subarray average technique is used to estimate the covariance matrix of the echo signals. The field II simulation of point targets and cyst phantoms was used to prove the performance of the proposed method. An RF data experiment was applied to support the feasibility and validity of our method. The simulation and experimental results show that our method has a lower computational complexity as O(9/2L<sup>2</sup>) , where L denotes the sub-array size, and has equivalent performance like the MV and DMAS beamformer.",
  "Increased mutability to fosfomycin resistance in Proteus mirabilis clinical isolates.\nIn the present study, we screened a collection of 77 Proteus mirabilis clinical isolates for the presence of mutators, using the frequency of both rifampicin and fosfomycin resistance mutants as markers of spontaneous mutagenesis. We found that none of the strains in our collection are mutators for the rifampicin resistance (Rif<sup>R</sup>) marker. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the isolates (17%) show high frequencies of fosfomycin resistant mutants (Fos<sup>R</sup>). We show that this increased mutability to Fos<sup>R</sup> correlates with a low level of resistance to Fosfomycin (MICs 8-64&#956;g/ml). These strains also show high frequencies of single step mutants with clinically relevant Fos<sup>R</sup> resistance levels (MIC &#8805;256&#956;g/ml). Our findings point out to the risk of fosfomycin resistance emergence in P. mirabilis.",
  "The identification of high potential archers based on fitness and motor ability variables: A Support Vector Machine approach.\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) has been shown to be an effective learning algorithm for classification and prediction. However, the application of SVM for prediction and classification in specific sport has rarely been used to quantify/discriminate low and high-performance athletes. The present study classified and predicted high and low-potential archers from a set of fitness and motor ability variables trained on different SVMs kernel algorithms. 50 youth archers with the mean age and standard deviation of 17.0 ± 0.6 years drawn from various archery programmes completed a six arrows shooting score test. Standard fitness and ability measurements namely hand grip, vertical jump, standing broad jump, static balance, upper muscle strength and the core muscle strength were also recorded. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (HACA) was used to cluster the archers based on the performance variables tested. SVM models with linear, quadratic, cubic, fine RBF, medium RBF, as well as the coarse RBF kernel functions, were trained based on the measured performance variables. The HACA clustered the archers into high-potential archers (HPA) and low-potential archers (LPA), respectively. The linear, quadratic, cubic, as well as the medium RBF kernel functions models, demonstrated reasonably excellent classification accuracy of 97.5% and 2.5% error rate for the prediction of the HPA and the LPA. The findings of this investigation can be valuable to coaches and sports managers to recognise high potential athletes from a combination of the selected few measured fitness and motor ability performance variables examined which would consequently save cost, time and effort during talent identification programme.",
  "In-situ deposition of sodium titanate thin film as anode for sodium-ion micro-batteries developed by pulsed laser deposition.\nSodium-ion thin-film micro-batteries form a niche sector of energy storage devices. Sodium titanate, Na<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>6</sub>O<sub>13</sub> (NTO) thin films were deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using solid-state synthesized polycrystalline Na<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>6</sub>O<sub>13</sub> compound. The phase-purity and crystallinity of NTO in bulk and thin-film forms were confirmed by Rietveld refinement. Electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed the formation of uniform &#8764;100&#8239;nm thin film with roughness of &#8764;4&#8239;nm consisting of homogeneous nanoscale grains. These PLD-deposited NTO thin-films, when tested in Na-half cell architecture, delivered a near theoretical reversible capacity close to 42&#8239;mA&#8239;h&#8239;g<sup>-1</sup> involving Ti<sup>4+</sup>/Ti<sup>3+</sup> redox activity along with good cycling stability and rate kinetics. Na<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>6</sub>O<sub>13</sub> can work as an efficient and safe anode in designing sodium-ion thin-film micro-batteries.",
  "Structure and properties of hybrid biopolymer particles fabricated by co-precipitation cross-linking dissolution procedure.\nThe Co-precipitation Crosslinking Dissolution technique (CCD-technique) allows a few-steps fabrication of particles composed of different biopolymers and bioactive agents under mild conditions. Morphology and properties of the fabricated biopolymer particles depend on the fabrication conditions, the nature of the biopolymers and additives, but also on the choice of the inorganic templates for co-precipitation. Here, we investigate the influence of an acidic biopolymer, hyaluronic acid (HA), on the formation of particles from bovine hemoglobin and bovine serum albumin applying co-precipitation with CaCO<sub>3</sub> and MnCO<sub>3</sub>. CaCO<sub>3</sub> templated biopolymer particles are almost spherical with particle size from 2 to 20&#8239;&#181;m and protein entrapment efficiency from 13 to 77%. Presence of HA causes significant structural changes of the particles and decreasing protein entrapment efficiency. In contrast, MnCO<sub>3</sub> templated particles exhibit uniform peanut shape and submicron size with remarkably high protein entrapment efficiency of nearly 100%. Addition of HA has no influence on the protein entrapment efficiency or on morphology and size of the particles. These effects can be attributed to the strong interaction of Mn<sup>2+</sup> with proteins and much weaker interaction with HA. Therefore, entrapment efficiency, size and structure of biopolymer particles can be optimized by varying the mineral templates and additives.",
  "Elemental sulfur reduction to H<sub>2</sub>S by Tetrahymena thermophila.\nEukaryotic nucleocytoplasm is believed to be descended from ancient Archaea that respired on elemental sulfur. If so, a vestige of sulfur reduction might persist in modern eukaryotic cells. That was tested in Tetrahymena thermophila, chosen as a model organism. When oxygenated, the cells consumed H<sub>2</sub>S rapidly, but when made anoxic they produced H<sub>2</sub>S mostly by amino acid catabolism. That could be inhibited by adding aminooxyacetic acid, and then H<sub>2</sub>S production from elemental sulfur became more evident. Anoxic cell lysates produced H<sub>2</sub>S when provided with sulfur and NADH, but not with either substrate alone. When lysates were fractionated by centrifugation, NADH-dependent H<sub>2</sub>S production was 83% in the soluble fraction. When intact cells that had just previously oxidized H<sub>2</sub>S were shifted to anoxia, the cells produced H<sub>2</sub>S evidently by re-using the oxidized sulfur. After aerobic H<sub>2</sub>S oxidation was stopped, the oxidation product remained available for H<sub>2</sub>S production for about 10&#8239;min. The observed H<sub>2</sub>S production is consistent with an evolutionary relationship of nucleocytoplasm to sulfur-reducing Archaea. Mitochondria often are the cellular site of H<sub>2</sub>S oxidation, suggesting that eukaryotic cells might have evolved from an ancient symbiosis that was based upon sulfur exchange.",
  "Surface Reformation of Medical Devices with DLC Coating.\nWe evaluated the adhesion, friction characteristics, durability against bodily acids, sterilization, cleaning, and anti-reflection performance of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings formed as a surface treatment of intracorporeal medical devices. The major coefficients of friction during intubation in a living body in all environments were lower with DLC coatings than with black chrome plating. DLC demonstrated an adhesion of approximately 24 N, which is eight times stronger than that of black chrome plating. DLC-coated samples also showed significant stability without being damaged during acid immersion and high-pressure steam sterilization, as suggested by the results of durability tests. In addition, the coatings remained unpeeled in a usage environment, and there was no change in the anti-reflection performance of the DLC coatings. In summary, DLC coatings are useful for improving intracorporeal device surfaces and extending the lives of medical devices.",
  "Overdurability and Technical Wear of Materials Used in the Construction of Old Buildings.\nThe technical maintenance of old tenement houses traditionally constructed is an ongoing problem, and will continue to be so in the coming years. The subject of the article includes old residential buildings from the turn of the XIX and XX centuries, which are a part of Wroclaw's downtown district. They can be understood as an essential link in the process of shaping the cultural and social microenvironment of man. The ability of them to meet the multiple expectations of residents depends on the natural aging of tenement houses' materials, the methods of their maintenance and use, and the influence of the many factors that cause their accelerated wear. The assumed durability is the main reference parameter of the changing age of the inspected tenement houses. The course of the theoretical and observed degree of the technical wear of these buildings was compared with their durability. For the age of these buildings, the technical wear should reach 100%. It was observed that in the first period of use of tenement houses, the phenomenon of \"infradurability\" occurs, and after exceeding a certain age-depending on the maintenance conditions of the building-the phenomenon of \"overdurability\" of the building occurs. It was shown that the durability of important elements of old buildings, as a parameter that was defined \"a posteriori\", ranges from 153 to 177 years, and is greater than the corresponding literature values indicated \"a priori\". The probability of reaching such an age of an element, in which the observed values of technical wear exceed the theoretical values, is much higher than the probability of an opposite event. A comparative analysis of the distribution functions of these probabilities indicates that the probabilities of theoretical wear values are higher than those observed in the case of the assumed literature durability of elements. There is also an inverse relationship for durability that corresponds to the age of the oldest examined elements of tenement houses.",
  "How do walkers behave when crossing the way of a mobile robot that replicates human interaction rules?\nPrevious studies showed the existence of implicit interaction rules shared by human walkers when crossing each other. Especially, each walker contributes to the collision avoidance task and the crossing order, as set at the beginning, is preserved along the interaction. This order determines the adaptation strategy: the first arrived increases his/her advance by slightly accelerating and changing his/her heading, whereas the second one slows down and moves in the opposite direction. In this study, we analyzed the behavior of human walkers crossing the trajectory of a mobile robot that was programmed to reproduce this human avoidance strategy. In contrast with a previous study, which showed that humans mostly prefer to give the way to a non-reactive robot, we observed similar behaviors between human-human avoidance and human-robot avoidance when the robot replicates the human interaction rules. We discuss this result in relation with the importance of controlling robots in a human-like way in order to ease their cohabitation with humans.",
  "Automated Sensing System for Real-Time Recognition of Trucks in River Dredging Areas Using Computer Vision and Convolutional Deep Learning.\nSand theft or illegal mining in river dredging areas has been a problem in recent decades. For this reason, increasing the use of artificial intelligence in dredging areas, building automated monitoring systems, and reducing human involvement can effectively deter crime and lighten the workload of security guards. In this investigation, a smart dredging construction site system was developed using automated techniques that were arranged to be suitable to various areas. The aim in the initial period of the smart dredging construction was to automate the audit work at the control point, which manages trucks in river dredging areas. Images of dump trucks entering the control point were captured using monitoring equipment in the construction area. The obtained images and the deep learning technique, YOLOv3, were used to detect the positions of the vehicle license plates. Framed images of the vehicle license plates were captured and were used as input in an image classification model, C-CNN-L3, to identify the number of characters on the license plate. Based on the classification results, the images of the vehicle license plates were transmitted to a text recognition model, R-CNN-L3, that corresponded to the characters of the license plate. Finally, the models of each stage were integrated into a real-time truck license plate recognition (TLPR) system; the single character recognition rate was 97.59%, the overall recognition rate was 93.73%, and the speed was 0.3271 s/image. The TLPR system reduces the labor force and time spent to identify the license plates, effectively reducing the probability of crime and increasing the transparency, automation, and efficiency of the frontline personnel's work. The TLPR is the first step toward an automated operation to manage trucks at the control point. The subsequent and ongoing development of system functions can advance dredging operations toward the goal of being a smart construction site. By intending to facilitate an intelligent and highly efficient management system of dredging-related departments by providing a vehicle LPR system, this paper forms a contribution to the current body of knowledge in the sense that it presents an objective approach for the TLPR system.",
  "Single-Trial Recognition of Video Gamer's Expertise from Brain Haemodynamic and Facial Emotion Responses.\nWith an increase in consumer demand of video gaming entertainment, the game industry is exploring novel ways of game interaction such as providing direct interfaces between the game and the gamers' cognitive or affective responses. In this work, gamer's brain activity has been imaged using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) whilst they watch video of a video game (League of Legends) they play. A video of the face of the participants is also recorded for each of a total of 15 trials where a trial is defined as watching a gameplay video. From the data collected, i.e., gamer's fNIRS data in combination with emotional state estimation from gamer's facial expressions, the expertise level of the gamers has been decoded per trial in a multi-modal framework comprising of unsupervised deep feature learning and classification by state-of-the-art models. The best tri-class classification accuracy is obtained using a cascade of random convolutional kernel transform (ROCKET) feature extraction method and deep classifier at 91.44%. This is the first work that aims at decoding expertise level of gamers using non-restrictive and portable technologies for brain imaging, and emotional state recognition derived from gamers' facial expressions. This work has profound implications for novel designs of future human interactions with video games and brain-controlled games.",
  "Viability of sublethally injured coliform bacteria on fresh-cut cabbage stored in high CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres following rinsing with electrolyzed water.\nThe extent of sublethally injured coliform bacteria on shredded cabbage, either rinsed or not rinsed with electrolyzed water, was evaluated during storage in air and high CO<sub>2</sub> controlled atmospheres (5%, 10%, and 15%) at 5&#176;C and 10&#176;C using the thin agar layer (TAL) method. Sublethally injured coliform bacteria on nonrinsed shredded cabbage were either absent or they were injured at a 64-65% level when present. Rinsing of shredded cabbage with electrolyzed water containing 25ppm available chlorine reduced the coliform counts by 0.4 to 1.1 log and caused sublethal injury ranging from 42 to 77%. Pantoea ananatis was one of the species injured by chlorine stress. When shredded cabbage, nonrinsed or rinsed with electrolyzed water, was stored in air and high CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres at 5&#176;C for 7days and 10&#176;C for 5days, coliform counts on TAL plates increased from 3.3-4.5 to 6.5-9.0 log CFU/g during storage, with the increase being greater at 10&#176;C than at 5&#176;C. High CO<sub>2</sub> of 10% and 15% reduced the bacterial growth on shredded cabbage during storage at 5&#176;C. Although injured coliform bacteria were not found on nonrinsed shredded cabbage on the initial day, injured coliforms at a range of 49-84% were detected on samples stored in air and high CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres at 5&#176;C and 10&#176;C. Injured cells were detected more frequently during storage at both temperatures irrespective of the CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere when shredded cabbage was rinsed with electrolyzed water. These results indicated that injured coliform bacteria on shredded cabbage, either rinsed or not rinsed with electrolyzed water, exhibited different degrees of injury during storage regardless of the CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere and temperature tested.",
  "Molecular and Clinical Features of EGFR-TKI-Associated Lung Injury.\nThe tyrosine kinase activity of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) plays critical roles in cell proliferation, regeneration, tumorigenesis, and anticancer resistance. Non-small-cell lung cancer patients who responded to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and obtained survival benefits had somatic EGFR mutations. EGFR-TKI-related adverse events (AEs) are usually tolerable and manageable, although serious AEs, including lung injury (specifically, interstitial lung disease (ILD), causing 58% of EGFR-TKI treatment-related deaths), occur infrequently. The etiopathogenesis of EGFR-TKI-induced ILD remains unknown. Risk factors, such as tobacco exposure, pre-existing lung fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and poor performance status, indicate that lung inflammatory circumstances may worsen with EGFR-TKI treatment because of impaired epithelial healing of lung injuries. There is limited evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of the mechanisms underlying EGFR-TKI-induced ILD in the available literature. Herein, we evaluated the relationship between EGFR-TKIs and AEs, especially ILD. Recent reports on mechanisms inducing lung injury or resistance in cytokine-rich circumstances were reviewed. We discussed the relevance of cytotoxic agents or immunotherapeutic agents in combination with EGFR-TKIs as a potential mechanism of EGFR-TKI-related lung injury and reviewed recent developments in diagnostics and therapeutics that facilitate recovery from lung injury or overcoming resistance to anti-EGFR treatment.",
  "Selective production of hydrogen ion species at atomically designed nanotips.\nHydrogen scanning ion microscopy systems rely on nanotip gas field ion sources to generate the hydrogen ion beam. The exact structure of the nanotip and the applied electric field are shown to be important. It is demonstrated that hydrogen ion beams are found to occur as mixtures of H<sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> and H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> depending on the electric field strength and the nanotip structure. Various nanotips were prepared, including single atom tips (SATs), trimers and other nano-structured tips to compare the contents of hydrogen ion beams. It was found that single atom tips produce primarily H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> at low operating voltages, but as the voltage is increased, H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> dominates. For the trimer case, H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> becomes a significant species and equals the H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> current but H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> can be isolated at higher voltages. For the hexamer tip structure, H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> almost completely dominates with little H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> being produced. H<sup>+</sup> is only observed in small quantities for all tip structures until a high voltage regime, where apex atom resolution is not observed. Comparisons W SATs and Ir SATs showed similar H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> product ratios indicating the nanotip structure plays a key role in the catalytic formation of H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>. Temperature affects are also discussed and operating parameters for single species ion beams are discussed.",
  "Constrictive bronchiolitis presenting with a mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern, associated with acid reflux.\nA previously healthy 55-year-old woman presented with worsening dyspnoea on exertion. The patient lived at altitude, did not smoke and had no exposure to occupational or environmental toxins. Her physical examination, including pulmonary, was unremarkable. Pulmonary function tests showed forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio 74% predicted, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) 92% predicted and residual volume 213% predicted. Rheumatological workup was negative. Chest radiograph showed hyperinflation without consolidation, and high-resolution chest CT showed mosaic attenuation with air trapping on expiratory imaging. A decreasing DLCO lead to transbronchial biopsies that were inconclusive. A video-assisted thoracic surgery lung biopsy showed small airway disease suggestive of constrictive bronchiolitis. Oesophagram and a barium swallow showed a hiatal hernia with large volume gastro-oesophageal reflux to the level of the clavicles. The development of constrictive bronchiolitis in this patient was possibly secondary to hiatal hernia and silent gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In the face of presumably idiopathic lung disease, clinicians should perform a GERD workup even in the absence of GERD symptoms.",
  "Three-vessel coronary artery aneurysmal disease complicated by multivessel thrombosis and cardiogenic shock: the saving role of intracoronary thrombolysis.\nThe benefit of intracoronary thrombolytics in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is not well established. Mainstays of STEMI management include intravenous thrombolytics, percutaneous coronary interventions and surgical revascularisation. However, in cases of STEMI secondary to coronary artery aneurysmal disease (CAAD), standard treatment options may not be suitable due to high thrombus burden, perioperative risk and factors unique to each patient. Thus, STEMI management in CAAD can represent a therapeutically challenging clinical scenario. Here, we describe a patient with severe three-vessel CAAD complicated by multivessel thrombosis and cardiogenic shock for whom traditional management options including placement of haemodynamic support devices were not feasible. As an alternative measure, the patient was treated with intracoronary thrombolysis with remarkable clinical stabilisation and angiographic resolution of thrombosis. He remains clinically stable several years later without recurrent events. This case serves to demonstrate the potential lifesaving benefit of intracoronary thrombolysis in complicated multivessel CAAD.",
  "Autoimmune nodo-paranodopathies of peripheral nerve: the concept is gaining ground.\nPeripheral neuropathies are classified as primarily demyelinating or axonal. Microstructural alterations of the nodal region are the key to understand the pathophysiology of neuropathies with antibodies to gangliosides and the new category of nodo-paranodopathy has been proposed to better characterise these disorders and overcome some inadequacies of the dichotomous classification. Recently, the research in autoimmune neuropathies has been boosted by reports of patients carrying immunoglobulin G4 antibodies against paranodal axo-glial proteins with distinct phenotypes and showing loss of transverse bands, terminal myelin loop detachment, nodal widening and axonal loss. These patients have been classified up to now as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy but, in our opinion, better fit into the nodo-paranodopathy category because nerve injury is due to dismantling of the paranode, segmental de-remyelination is absent and the pathogenic mechanism is not inflammatory. Evidence from nerve conductions and electron microscopy studies in patients and mutant animal models can reconcile the apparent contrast between the electrophysiological 'demyelinating' features, explainable just by the paranodal involvement and the axonal pathology. These patients broaden the autoimmune nodo-paranodopathy category and re-emphasise the usage of the term that pointing to the site of nerve injury reminds specific pathophysiological mechanisms, reconciles contrasting electrophysiological and pathological findings, and avoids misdiagnosis and taxonomic confusion. In our opinion, the nodo-paranodopathy term more adequately classifies the peripheral nerve disorders due to an autoimmune attack directed and limited to the nodal region integrating the traditional classification of peripheral neuropathies.",
  "Differential Kinetics of Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus Phagocytosis.\nInvasive aspergillosis mainly occurs in immunocompromised patients and is commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, while A.nidulans is rarely the causative agent. However, in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients, A. nidulans is a frequent cause of invasive aspergillosis and is associated with higher mortality. Immune recognition of A. nidulans was compared to A. fumigatus to offer an insight into why A. nidulans infections are prevalent in CGD. Live cell imaging with J774A.1 macrophage-like cells and LC3-GFP-mCherry bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) revealed that phagocytosis of A. nidulans was slower compared to A. fumigatus. This difference could be attributed to slower migration of J774A.1 cells and a lower percentage of migrating BMDMs. In addition, delayed phagosome acidification and LC3-associated phagocytosis was observed with A. nidulans. Cytokine and oxidative burst measurements in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed a lower oxidative burst upon challenge with A. nidulans. In contrast, A. nidulans induced significantly higher concentrations of cytokines. Collectively, our data demonstrate that A. nidulans is phagocytosed and processed at a slower rate compared to A. fumigatus, resulting in reduced fungal killing and increased germination of conidia. This slower rate of A. nidulans clearance may be permissive for overgrowth within certain immune settings.",
  "Familial X/Y Translocation Encompassing ARSE in Two Moroccan Siblings with Sensorineural Deafness.\nUnbalanced translocations involving X and Y chromosomes are rare and associated with a contiguous gene syndrome. The clinical phenotype is heterogeneous including mainly short stature, chondrodysplasia punctata, ichthyosis, hypogonadism, and intellectual disability. Here, we report 2 brothers with peculiar gestalt, short stature, and hearing loss, who harbor an X/Y translocation. Physical examination, brainstem acoustic potential evaluation, bone age, hormonal assessment, and X-ray investigations were performed. Because of their dysmorphic features, karyotyping, FISH, and aCGH were carried out. The probands had short stature, hypertelorism, midface hypoplasia, sensorineural hearing loss, normal intelligence as well as slight radial and ulnar bowing with brachytelephalangy. R-banding identified a derivative X chromosome with an abnormally expanded short arm. The mother was detected as a carrier of the same aberrant X chromosome. aCGH disclosed a 3.1-Mb distal deletion of chromosome region Xp22.33pter. This interval encompasses several genes, especially the short stature homeobox (SHOX) and arylsulfatase (ARSE) genes. The final karyotype of the probands was: 46,Y,der(X),t(X;Y)(p22;q12).ish der(X)(DXYS129-,DXYS153-)mat.arr[hg19] Xp22.33(61091_2689408)×1mat,Xp22.33(2701273_3258404)×0mat,Yq11.222q12 (21412851_59310245)×2. Herein, we describe a Moroccan family with a maternally inherited X/Y translocation and discuss the genotype-phenotype correlations according to the deleted genes.",
  "Hyper-Angle Exploitative Searching for Enabling Multi-Objective Optimization of Fog Computing.\nFog computing is an emerging technology. It has the potential of enabling various wireless networks to offer computational services based on certain requirements given by the user. Typically, the users give their computing tasks to the network manager that has the responsibility of allocating needed fog nodes optimally for conducting the computation effectively. The optimal allocation of nodes with respect to various metrics is essential for fast execution and stable, energy-efficient, balanced, and cost-effective allocation. This article aims to optimize multiple objectives using fog computing by developing multi-objective optimization with high exploitive searching. The developed algorithm is an evolutionary genetic type designated as Hyper Angle Exploitative Searching (HAES). It uses hyper angle along with crowding distance for prioritizing solutions within the same rank and selecting the highest priority solutions. The approach was evaluated on multi-objective mathematical problems and its superiority was revealed by comparing its performance with benchmark approaches. A framework of multi-criteria optimization for fog computing was proposed, the Fog Computing Closed Loop Model (FCCL). Results have shown that HAES outperforms other relevant benchmarks in terms of non-domination and optimality metrics with over 70% confidence of the t-test for rejecting the null-hypothesis of non-superiority in terms of the domination metric set coverage.",
  "DDX6 Is Essential for Oocyte Development and Maturation in <i>Locusta migratoria</i>.\nDEAD-box protein 6 (DDX6) is a member of the DDX RNA helicase family that exists in all eukaryotes. It has been extensively studied in yeast and mammals and has been shown to be involved in messenger ribonucleoprotein assembly, mRNA storage, and decay, as well as in miRNA-mediated gene silencing. DDX6 participates in many developmental processes but the biological function of DDX6 in insects has not yet been adequately addressed. Herein, we characterized the <i>LmDDX6</i> gene that encodes the LmDDX6 protein in <i>Locusta migratoria</i>, a global, destructive pest. LmDDX6 possesses five motifs unique to the DDX6 subfamily. In the phylogenetic tree, LmDDX6 was closely related to its orthologs in <i>Apis dorsata</i> and <i>Zootermopsis nevadensis</i>. RT-qPCR data revealed high expression of <i>LmDDX6</i> in the ovary, muscle, and fat body, with a declining trend in the ovary after adult ecdysis. <i>LmDDX6</i> knockdown downregulated the expression levels of the juvenile hormone receptor <i>Met,</i> and genes encoding Met downstream targeted <i>Grp78-1</i> and <i>Grp78-2</i>, reduced <i>LmVg</i> expression, and impaired ovary development and oocyte maturation. These results demonstrate that <i>LmDDX6</i> plays an essential role in locust female reproduction and, thus, could be a novel target for locust biological control.",
  "Dental skeletal effects of the metallic splinted Herbst appliance after growth spurt: a lateral oblique cephalometric assessment.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate dental and skeletal changes induced by the use of Herbst appliance compared to natural growth in young adults with Class II division I malocclusion with mandibular retrusion, by means of lateral oblique radiographs. Forty-six subjects, I4 -18 years old, after pubertal growth peak, with Class II division I malocclusion were assessed. Subjects were divided into two groups: the Experimental group included 23 subjects treated with Metallic Splinted Herbst and the Control group included 23 subjects followed without treatment. The Experimental and Control groups were paired by sex and chronological age. Oblique lateral cephalometric radiographs of the left and the right side of the mandible before treatment (TI) and after 8 months' treatment (T2) were used to evaluate dental and skeletal changes. Statistical analysis was performed with Intra Class Correlation and Student t-test, according to the study hypothesis. The results showed that the appliance corrected the Class II relationship in an 8-month period by mesial tipping movement of lower permanent first molars. It had little influence on mandibular structure and mandibular length and no influence on maxillary structure and upper molar. To conclude, late treatment of Class II malocclusion with the Herbst appliance was accomplished by means of dentoalveolar changes. These findings suggest that this type of treatment can be used in patients after growth has ceased because the results do not depend upon skeletal changes.",
  "Surface wear of resin composites used for Invisalign® attachments.\nOrthodontic treatments with Invisalign® require the use of attachments, which are composite resin buttons attached to tooth surfaces. Attachments constitute one of the most powerful tools for improving the efficiency of orthodontic tooth movement. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate surface wear over six months in two resin composites (Filtek Z350 XT, 3MESPE and Amelogen Plus TW, Ultradent Products Inc. ) used for making Invisalign® attachments. These composites were selected for their esthetic and mechanical properties. Forty attachments were bonded to the buccal surface of maxillary teeth. Materials were randomized and assigned in a double blind manner. Impressions were taken of the attachments using a preestablished technique immediately after bonding and following 6 months of clinical use. The impressions were examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) at 12-fold magnification to identify changes in surface texture and attachment shape. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney's test on the overall ranking of detected changes in those variables. Statistically significant differences (P<0. 001) were found for surface wear, with greater changes in Amelogen Plus. Attachment shape did not change significantly in either material (P>0. 05). According to the results of this study, the alteration of the attachment surface during the first six months of treatment depends on the composite used, while attachment shape does not appear to be affected, so the clinical performance of the materials evaluated could be considered acceptable.",
  "Elastic Multi-scale Mechanisms: Computation and Biological Evolution.\nExplanations based on low-level interacting elements are valuable and powerful since they contribute to identify the key mechanisms of biological functions. However, many dynamic systems based on low-level interacting elements with unambiguous, finite, and complete information of initial states generate future states that cannot be predicted, implying an increase of complexity and open-ended evolution. Such systems are like Turing machines, that overlap with dynamical systems that cannot halt. We argue that organisms find halting conditions by distorting these mechanisms, creating conditions for a constant creativity that drives evolution. We introduce a modulus of elasticity to measure the changes in these mechanisms in response to changes in the computed environment. We test this concept in a population of predators and predated cells with chemotactic mechanisms and demonstrate how the selection of a given mechanism depends on the entire population. We finally explore this concept in different frameworks and postulate that the identification of predictive mechanisms is only successful with small elasticity modulus.",
  "Inability of DNAzymes to cleave RNA in vivo is due to limited Mg[Formula: see text] concentration in cells.\nSequence specific cleavage of RNA can be achieved by hammerhead ribozymes as well as DNAzymes. They comprise a catalytic core sequence flanked by regions that form double strands with complementary RNA. While different types of ribozymes have been discovered in natural organisms, DNAzymes derive from in vitro selection. Both have been used for therapeutic down-regulation of harmful proteins by reducing drastically the corresponding mRNA concentration. A priori DNAzymes appear advantageous because of the higher haemolytic stability and better cost effectiveness when compared to RNA. In the present work the 10-23 DNAzyme was applied to knockdown expression of the prion protein (PrP), the sole causative agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. We selected accessible target sequences on the PrP mRNA based on a sequential folding algorithm. Very high effectivity of DNAzymes was found for cleavage of RNA in vitro, but activity in neuroblastoma cells was very low. However, siRNA directed to the identical target sequences reduced expression of PrP in the same cell type. According to our analysis, three Mg[Formula: see text] bind cooperatively to the DNAzyme to exert full activity. However, free ATP binds the Mg[Formula: see text] ions more strongly and already stoichiometric amounts of Mg[Formula: see text] and ATP inhibited the activity of DNAzymes drastically. In contrast, natural ribozymes form three-dimensional structures close to the cleavage site that stabilize the active conformation at much lower Mg[Formula: see text] concentrations. For DNAzymes, however, a similar stabilization is not known and therefore DNAzymes need higher free Mg[Formula: see text] concentrations than that available inside the cell.",
  "Sub-100-nm Nearly Monodisperse n-Paraffin/PMMA Phase Change Nanobeads.\nIn this study, we demonstrate the colloidal synthesis of nearly monodisperse, sub-100-nm phase change material (PCM) nanobeads with an organic n-paraffin core and poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) shell. PCM nanobeads are synthesized via emulsion polymerization using ammonium persulfate as an initiator and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate as a surfactant. The highly uniform n-paraffin/PMMA PCM nanobeads are sub-100 nm in size and exhibit superior colloidal stability. Furthermore, the n-paraffin/PMMA PCM nanobeads exhibit reversible phase transition behaviors during the n-paraffin melting and solidification processes. During the solidification process, multiple peaks with relatively reduced phase change temperatures are observed, which are related to the phase transition of n-paraffin in the confined structure of the PMMA nanobeads. The phase change temperatures are further tailored by changing the carbon length of n-paraffin while maintaining the size uniformity of the PCM nanobeads. Sub-100-nm-sized and nearly monodisperse PCM nanobeads can be potentially utilized in thermal energy storage and drug delivery because of their high colloidal stability and solution processability.",
  "Human c-SRC kinase (CSK) overexpression makes T cells dummy.\nAdoptive cell therapy with T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells represents a powerful method to redirect the immune system against tumours. However, although TCR recognition is restricted to a specific peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex, increasing numbers of reports have shown cross-reactivity and off-target effects with severe consequences for the patients. This demands further development of strategies to validate TCR safety prior to clinical use. We reasoned that the desired TCR signalling depends on correct pMHC recognition on the outside and a restricted clustering on the inside of the cell. Since the majority of the adverse events are due to TCR recognition of the wrong target, we tested if blocking the signalling would affect the binding. By over-expressing the c-SRC kinase (CSK), a negative regulator of LCK, in redirected T cells, we showed that peripheral blood T cells inhibited anti-CD3/anti-CD28-induced phosphorylation of ERK, whereas TCR proximal signalling was not affected. Similarly, overexpression of CSK together with a therapeutic TCR prevented pMHC-induced ERK phosphorylation. Downstream effector functions were also almost completely blocked, including pMHC-induced IL-2 release, degranulation and, most importantly, target cell killing. The lack of effector functions contrasted with the unaffected TCR expression, pMHC recognition, and membrane exchange activity (trogocytosis). Therefore, co-expression of CSK with a therapeutic TCR did not compromise target recognition and binding, but rendered T cells incapable of executing their effector functions. Consequently, we named these redirected T cells \"dummy T cells\" and propose to use them for safety validation of new TCRs prior to therapy.",
  "A Study of the Longitudinal Patterns of Stimulant and Amyl Nitrite Use and Sexual Behavior Pre- and Post-HIV Seroconversion Among MSM.\nThe use of stimulant drugs alone or in combination with amyl nitrites (stimulant/nitrites) has been associated with higher rates of risky sexual behavior and predictive of HIV infection among men who have sex with men. However, the temporal pattern of stimulant/nitrite use pre- and post-seroconversion has not been well established. This study assessed changes in stimulant/nitrite use and risky sexual behavior among seroconverting MSM over time. Data were collected in the Baltimore-Washington, DC; Pittsburgh; Chicago; and Los Angeles sites of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longitudinal study of the natural history of HIV infection among MSM. We used propensity scores to select 1044 MSM from 7087 MACS participants composed of 348 seroconverting, 348 seronegative, and 348 seroprevalent participants matched on demographics, recruitment cohort, and study visits. We centered up to four-years of semi-annual data around the seroconversion visit of the seroconverting case within each matched group of participants. Mixed effects regressions estimated the effects of serostatus, recruitment cohort, and time on self-reported stimulant/nitrite use, numbers of male intercourse partners, and numbers of unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) partners. Covariates included demographics, binge drinking, and marijuana use. Seroconverters had the highest odds of stimulant/inhaled nitrite use (AOR 10.3, CI 4.8-22.0), incident rates of intercourse (IRR 1.6, CI 1.3-2.1), and URAI partners (IRR 5.1, CI 3.5-7.3). All participants decreased drug use and sexual risk behavior over time. However, the decreases were largest for seroconverters who nevertheless maintained the highest rates of stimulant/nitrite use and sexual risk. Cohort-related effects were associated with sharp reductions in stimulant/nitrite use and URAI in the early 1990s that rebounded considerably within the first decade of the 2000s. Although all participants decreased risky sexual behavior and stimulant and/or nitrite use over time, seroconverters had the largest decreases. There was no evidence for abrupt or substantial increases in drug use or risky sex post-seroconversion. However, there was substantial variation at the individual level, with the factors underlying this variation not well understood and worth further study. Moreover, stimulant/nitrite use and risky sexual behavior appear to have been strongly influenced by contextual historical and socio-cultural effects. The manner in which contextual factors influence individual behavior is also not well understood and also warrants further study.",
  "Alteration of serum immunoglobins, C-reactive protein, vitamin D, and electrolyte by atenolol and amlodipine in stress-induced hypertensive rats.\nThe present study is designed for the assessment of various pathological changes like immunoglobins, C-reactive protein, vitamin D, sodium, potassium, calcium in stress-induced hypertensive rats. Albino Wistar rats of sex male were grouped into six. Each group consists of six animals. Groups were Group I (normal control), Group II (disease control), Group III (amlodipine control), Group IV (atenolol control), Group V (amlodipine treatment), and Group VI (atenolol treatment). Group II, V, and VI animals exposed to regular stress by placing them in cages individually and giving foot electric shocks (1 mA, 50 ms duration with 0.5-1 min of intervals regulated randomly by a computer) along with forced swimming (30 min) in order to induce hypertension in rats. This stress was given two times daily (morning and evening) for regular 15 days. Induction of hypertension was confirmed by measuring the tail arterial pressure of blood and angiotensin II. For next 1 month, Group III and V animals are treated with amlodipine with 1 mg/kg, s.c. dose while Group IV and VI animals were given 10 mg/kg, s.c. the dose of atenolol once daily. At the end of the experimental work, blood collected, rats sacrificed, and serum separated. Serum sodium, potassium, immunoglobins, C-reactive protein, vitamin D, and calcium were measured by semi-auto-analyzer. Stress-induced hypertension in rats produced altered serum sodium, potassium, immunoglobins, C-reactive protein, vitamin D, and calcium level which is restored by atenolol. Administration of amlodipine in animals without hypertension shows alteration in the level of immunoglobins, calcium, vitamin D, and electrolytes.",
  "Hoopoe males experience intra-seasonal while females experience inter-seasonal reproductive costs.\nReproductive and survival costs due to reproductive investment are a central element for the evolution of life histories. Both intra- (reduction of reproductive performance of second brood due to investment in first brood) and inter-seasonal costs (reduction of reproductive performance or annual survival due to reproductive investment in preceding year) may appear in multiple breeding species. Knowledge about how trade-offs within and between seasons shape individual trajectories and influence fitness are crucial in life-history evolution, yet intra- and inter-seasonal reproductive costs are rarely analysed simultaneously. We investigated sex-specific differences in intra- and inter-seasonal reproductive and survival costs in response to previous reproductive effort in a monogamous, double-brooding bird, the hoopoe (Upupa epops), accounting for heterogeneity in individual and annual quality. Intra-seasonal reproductive costs were detected in males and inter-seasonal reproductive and survival costs were detected in females. In males, the probability of being a successful double breeder was negatively correlated with the number of hatchlings produced in the first brood. In females, the number of fledglings raised in the first brood was negatively correlated with the reproductive effort in the preceding season. Female annual survival was also negatively influenced by the number of broods produced in the previous reproductive season. Most of these reproductive costs were detected only in years with low productivity, suggesting that costs become evident when environmental conditions are harsh. Our results illustrate how different investment in current vs. future reproduction and survival shape different life-history strategies in males and females of a monogamous bird species.",
  "Treatment of extraarticular knee extension contracture secondary to prolonged external fixation by a modified Judet quadricepsplasty technique.\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate the functional results of the modified Judet quadricepsplasty for a knee extension contracture secondary to prolonged external fixation. This is a retrospective study of 31 patients with the diagnosis of an extraarticular knee extension contracture who had prolonged external fixation of the femur. Functional assessment was conducted after a minimum follow-up of 1 year. After performing the functional assessment, according to the Judet scale, 51% of the 31 patients had good results and 19.35% (6 cases) showed excellent results. The improvement in mobility from pre-operative to post-operative range of motion was significant. The performance of the technique, following the authors' described steps and making the subsequent modifications, allowed for partial knee mobility restoration, which significantly improved the patients' functional status.",
  "A Novel Charging Method for Underwater Batteryless Sensor Node Networks.\nIn this paper, we present a novel charging method for underwater batteryless sensor node networks. The target application is a practical underwater sensor network for oceanic fish farms. The underwater sections of the network use a wireless power transfer system based on the ISO 11784/11785 HDX standard for supplying energy to the batteryless sensor nodes. Each sensor has an accumulator capacitor, which is charged for voltage supplying to the sensor node. A new distributed charging scheme is proposed and discussed in detail to reduce the required time to charge all sensor nodes of the underwater sections. One important key is its decentralized control of the charging process. The proposal is based on the self disconnection ability of each sensor node from the charging network. The second important key is that the hardware implementation of this new feature is quite simple and only requires to include a minimal circuitry in parallel to the current sensor node antenna while the rest of the sensor network remains unaltered. The proposed charging scheme is evaluated using real corner cases from practical oceanic fish farms sensor networks. The results from experiments demonstrate that it is possible to charge up to 10 sensor nodes which is the double charging capability than previous research presented. In the same conditions as the approach found in the literature, it represents reaching an ocean depth of 60 m. In terms of energy, in case of an underwater network with 5 sensors to reach 30 m deep, the proposed charging scheme requires only a 25% of the power required using the traditional approach.",
  "Challenges, Dilemmas and Factors Involved in PGD Decision-Making: Providers' and Patients' Views, Experiences and Decisions.\nProviders and patients are considering and pursuing PGD for ever-more conditions, but questions arise concerning how they make, view and experience these decisions, and what challenges they may face. Thirty-seven in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted (with 27 IVF providers and 10 patients). Patients and providers struggled with challenges and dilemmas about whether to pursue PGD in specific cases, and how to decide. Respondents varied in how they viewed, experienced and made these choices, and for which conditions to pursue PGD (from lethal, childhood-onset conditions to milder, treatable, or adult-onset disorders). Several factors were involved, including differences in gene penetrance, predictability, and phenotypic expression, and disease severity, age of onset, treatability, stigma and degree of disability. Providers and patients face questions regarding possibilities of screening for more than one condition in one set of embryos, and limitations of PGD (e.g., inaccurate results). Characteristics of providers (e.g., amount of PGD experience, understandings of genetics, and use of genetic counselors), and of patients (e.g., related to broader moral and social attitudes) can also affect these decisions. These data, the first to examine several key questions concerning PGD, suggest that providers and patients confront several dilemmas. These findings have critical implications for future practice, guidelines, education and research.",
  "Implementing Service-Learning Programs in Physical Education; Teacher Education as Teaching and Learning Models for All the Agents Involved: A Systematic Review.\nService-learning (SL) is the subject of a growing number of studies and is becoming increasingly popular in physical education teacher education (PETE) programs. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the implementation of SL programs with PETE students. The databases used were Web of Science, SPORTDiscus (EBSCO), and SCOPUS. Articles were selected on the basis of the following criteria: (a) published in a peer-reviewed journal; (b) covers the use of SL programs with PETE students; (c) relates to physical education or physical activity programs; (d) availability of a full-text version in English and/or Spanish. Thirty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. Two types of findings were observed: firstly, findings relating to the study characteristics and objectives and, secondly, recommendations for improvement of this type of intervention. The objectives of the different studies focused on (a) the impact of the SL methodology on PETE students' professional, social, and personal skills; (b) its impact on the community; (c) analysis of the effectiveness and quality of the programs. All but two studies analyzed the impact of SL on PETE, while only four analyzed community participants and only three analyzed the quality of the SL program. Recommendations for improving SL programs used with PETE students included: all stakeholders, e.g., students and community participants, should be studied and coordinated; the quality of the programs should be assessed, as studying the effectiveness of SL programs could help to attain the objectives of both students and the community; mixed methods should be used; and intervention implementation periods should be extended to provide more objective, controlled measurements."
